1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,066
France.

2
00:00:01,198 --> 00:00:02,622
Now, I know what you're thinking.

3
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:05,218
If you live in Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany,

4
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:07,774
Belgium, the UK, or God forbid, within France

5
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:10,194
itself, then you already know that you're not

6
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:11,410
very far away from France.

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,606
And if you live in somewhere like North America,

8
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:16,542
Asia, Australia or South America, then you know that

9
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:18,334
you live pretty far away from France.

10
00:00:18,442 --> 00:00:21,210
Except that that second part isn't really true,

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,782
because the France I showed you at the

12
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:25,330
beginning isn't really the entirety of France.

13
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,470
In reality, France is everywhere across

14
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,354
the world, like literally everywhere.

15
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,546
Here's France and North America, here's France and

16
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:35,734
South America in the Caribbean, including this island

17
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:37,662
right here, that's divided between France and the

18
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,398
Netherlands, meaning that France and the Netherlands actually

19
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:41,662
do share a border.

20
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:44,218
It's just not in Europe, it's in the Caribbean. Here's?

21
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:45,382
France? Closer to Mexico.

22
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,298
Here's France around Madagascar here's France in the Indian

23
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,958
Ocean and here's France in the Pacific Ocean With

24
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,314
all of these different locations across the globe, you're

25
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:55,362
probably not as far away from France as you

26
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:57,070
may have thought if you don't live in Europe.

27
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,986
Inspired by a map I found created by a

28
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:01,698
reddit user named Alhayle Madame, let's take a look

29
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:04,414
at how far away you really are from France.

30
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,702
Colored in black is France itself.

31
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:09,598
Within any of the red zones, you're unfortunately

32
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,214
less than a thousand kilometers away from sovereign

33
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:14,334
French territory, meaning that you could pretty much

34
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:16,738
begin hearing French at nearly any minute.

35
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,702
Areas like Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Maine,

36
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:23,286
Venezuela, Brazil, Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa are

37
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:25,350
pretty much all just as far away from

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,630
actual sovereign France as Germany or Austria.

39
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,690
Within the orange zone, you're less than two

40
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,746
0 France, which includes the entire northeastern United

41
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:37,638
States, most of Mexico, the entire Caribbean, and

42
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,914
a whole lot of Africa.

43
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:41,454
These zones keep radiating out until we're left

44
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,266
with this empty patch here across East Asia.

45
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,762
Within this zone, you're pretty safe because you're

46
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:50,502
more than seven 0 any French territory, and

47
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:53,554
it's the furthest possible area away from France

48
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:55,594
you can get anywhere on the planet.

49
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:58,482
Spanning across most of China, north Korea, the

50
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:01,582
Japanese island of Hokkaido, and far eastern Russia.

51
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,858
Now, the various parts of France that exist all

52
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:05,982
over the world outside of Europe that make all

53
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:08,674
of this possible are known as overseas France.

54
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:11,070
And it's this other part of France that makes

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,126
France a true global 21st century great power.

56
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:19,890
Altogether, these various islands and landmasses outside of Europe at

57
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:28,758
119 386 territory to the French Republic, which is 18%

58
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:32,070
of France's total land area and is roughly the same

59
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,582
size as either North Korea or Bulgaria.

60
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:38,526
It's huge, and nearly 3 million people live across

61
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,182
it all, which is about how many people live

62
00:02:40,196 --> 00:02:42,250
in the US state of Kansas, and it represents

63
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,550
about 4% of the entire French population.

64
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,298
Oh, yeah, and that's the thing.

65
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,494
They're all citizens of France and

66
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,418
therefore citizens of the European Union.

67
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:55,050
By extension as well, which makes all nearly 3 million

68
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,042
of them living in places as far away as the

69
00:02:57,056 --> 00:03:00,774
Caribbean, South America and the Pacific Ocean, all capable of

70
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:04,102
voting in both French and European elections.

71
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:06,870
And because of all these territories existing across

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,738
the globe, france is actually the country with

73
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:11,806
the highest number of time zones.

74
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:15,774
Russia, the world's largest country, spans across only

75
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:18,598
eleven time zones from west to east.

76
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:22,086
But France, all with her empire across the world,

77
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,942
actually spans across 13 time zones that are shared

78
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:28,822
with places as far away as Anchorage, Honolulu, Los

79
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:32,154
Angeles, New York City, rio de Janeiro, Paris, obviously

80
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:36,442
Moscow, Dubai, Karachi, Vladivostok, Sydney and Auckland.

81
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:39,270
It appears that in the 21st century, the sun

82
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,322
continues to never set on the French empire.

83
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:45,294
But that all just kind of begs another question

84
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:48,678
why in the world does France even have an

85
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:53,062
empire that's still this vast outside of Europe?

86
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,986
Well, like every other European power, france also

87
00:03:56,048 --> 00:03:58,026
got in on the overseas empire game over

88
00:03:58,088 --> 00:04:00,510
hundreds of years of progress, with colonies across

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,050
Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

90
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,594
But after World War II, the world stopped

91
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:07,138
being very sympathetic to colonies, and the colonies

92
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:10,726
of France gradually began declaring their own independence,

93
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:14,254
culminating with France's final colony in Africa, djibouti,

94
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:18,370
in the Pacific island of Vanuatu in 1980.

95
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,017
What remains are the final vestiges of the

96
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:24,250
ancient French colonial empire that simply never desired

97
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,378
independence for themselves and have thus remained a

98
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,518
part of 21st century France.

99
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:32,334
Some of them are totally uninhabited, or really only

100
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,142
home to seasonal scientists like Clipperton Island here in

101
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:37,942
the Pacific, the various islands of the southern Antarctic

102
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:42,042
lands and Adele Land, france's claim over Antarctica that

103
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,074
grants them direct access to the South Pole.

104
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,294
But all the other places are actually inhabited

105
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:48,762
by permanent populations of people, and some of

106
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:52,078
them are really hugely important places.

107
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:54,958
There's Reunion Island, way out here over by Madagascar

108
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,862
in the Indian Ocean, with a population of more

109
00:04:56,876 --> 00:05:01,038
than 8500 people, which alone is more than two

110
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:04,702
actual EU member states, malta and Luxembourg.

111
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,798
And nearly as much as a third, Cyprus,

112
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,482
nearby Myot, has an additional population of more

113
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:14,358
than 2700, meaning that there's over a million

114
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,462
French citizens living in the Indian Ocean.

115
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:19,302
Nearby Madagascar and Africa, both islands are

116
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:21,574
a fully fledged integral part of France.

117
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,502
They use Euros, and as such, they're the outermost

118
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:28,018
region of both the European Union and the Eurozone.

119
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:31,330
Like two distant moons orbiting around their faraway

120
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,922
planet, reunion is one of the few locations

121
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:36,390
the Europeans discovered across the world that was

122
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,342
actually truly uninhabited back at the time, and

123
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,238
the French acquired it back in the 17th

124
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:43,530
century and have simply kept it ever since.

125
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,562
But there's other big locations in France's

126
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,054
overseas territories, too, like French Kana, way

127
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:49,666
over here in South America.

128
00:05:49,738 --> 00:05:51,918
Just like Reunion, French Guyana is an

129
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:54,262
integral part of France that uses Euros

130
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:55,882
and is part of the European Union.

131
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:57,838
Despite bordering Brazil and containing

132
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,410
part of the Amazon rainforest.

133
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,402
This little chunk of Europe and France and South

134
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:04,294
America isn't really so little, though, because it's nearly

135
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,398
the same size as Austria and one 7th the

136
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:10,930
size of metropolitan France itself back in Europe, albeit

137
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,142
with a pretty little population of only about 3000

138
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:17,154
people, which means that the population density throughout is

139
00:06:17,192 --> 00:06:18,838
on a par with Siberia.

140
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:22,338
That's because nearly 99% of French Guiana is

141
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,134
completely covered by forests, including the Guiana Amazonian

142
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:28,770
Park, which alone takes up more than 40%

143
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,954
of French Guiana and is, hilariously, the largest

144
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:34,102
national park of the European Union.

145
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,378
Despite, well, you know, being located in South America,

146
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:40,674
french Kiana is immensely important to both France and

147
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:43,698
Europe today because it is the primary launch site

148
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:46,594
for rockets of the European Space Agency, or Isa.

149
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:48,558
And it's specifically because of

150
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:50,470
French Guiana's geographic location.

151
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,038
Look at this map of the world and then

152
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:55,002
think to yourself, where are the best locations possible

153
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:57,066
to blast rockets off into space from?

154
00:06:57,128 --> 00:06:59,322
The correct answer is as close as you can

155
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,614
get to the equator across the Earth's center.

156
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,758
And it's because here along this line, the

157
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:07,710
planet is rotating faster than anywhere else.

158
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,374
Rockets need all the speed they can get in order

159
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,898
to break out of Earth's gravity, and the Earth's natural

160
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,838
rotation speed can give them a muchneeded boost.

161
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:19,018
Unfortunately for Europe, the equator runs pretty considerably

162
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:21,802
far away from their continent, which makes blasting

163
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:24,334
rockets off from there a little more challenging.

164
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:27,954
But fortunately for Europe, they spent centuries taking over

165
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,934
colonies in other parts of the world, and it

166
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:32,902
turned out that French Guiana in particular is located

167
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,326
really, really close to the equator.

168
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,926
And so that's how this little chunk of

169
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:41,194
South America became Europe's most important spaceport.

170
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:43,746
It's so important that at one point back in

171
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:47,538
the 1990s, the Guiana Space Center alone accounted for

172
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:51,346
more than a quarter of French Guiana's entire GDP.

173
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:52,782
All right, so moving on over to the

174
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:56,062
Pacific, france retains possessions of hundreds of islands

175
00:07:56,086 --> 00:07:59,062
and atolls across French Polynesia, new Caledonia, wallace

176
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:01,638
and Fu, Tuna, and Clipperton Island, including the

177
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:04,126
island of Bora Bora inside of French Polynesia,

178
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:06,514
which is one of France's most popular tourist

179
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:09,634
destinations, despite being located on the complete opposite

180
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:11,530
side of the world from Paris.

181
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,298
But the Pacific part of France carries a

182
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,438
darker secret than the other parts of overseas

183
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:19,330
France does, because it was here that France

184
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,098
primarily conducted their decadeslong nuclear weapons testing.

185
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:25,918
Back in 1960, when the French empire still spanned

186
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:28,474
much more of the globe, france became the fourth

187
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:31,258
country to successfully test and detonate a nuclear weapon

188
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,246
after the United States, Soviet Union, and United Kingdom.

189
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:36,114
But they did so initially within

190
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,881
the empty deserts of Algeria.

191
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:40,158
Awkwardly, at the same time that Algeria was

192
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:42,258
fighting a war against France for their own

193
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:45,042
independence, france would go on to detonate a

194
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:47,538
total of 17 nuclear weapons inside of the

195
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,782
empty deserts of algeria before it became an

196
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:53,058
independent nation, after which they subsequently refused to

197
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,302
continue allowing France to test their nukes there.

198
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,998
So, still wanting to test their bombs

199
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,278
somewhere, they began looking for alternatives.

200
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,122
One such idea was to begin testing them

201
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:03,646
on the uninhabited Clipperton Island nearby to Mexico.

202
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:06,442
But this was ruled out because of the island's intense

203
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:09,582
level of remoteness, and also Mexico probably would have had

204
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:10,998
a thing or two to say about it.

205
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,978
Eventually, France settled on continuing their nuclear weapons

206
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:16,470
testing over in French Polynesia, where a total

207
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,566
of 193 detonations would be carried out in

208
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:22,534
the Pacific Ocean nearby, which brought France directly

209
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:26,466
into conflict with nearby New Zealand in 1985.

210
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:30,726
Back then, the organization Greenpeace orchestrated a campaign against

211
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:33,342
the continued French nuclear testing in the area with

212
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:36,286
a boat called the Rainbow Warrior, which was docked

213
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:38,458
in port outside of Auckland, New Zealand.

214
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:40,978
The ship was about to depart towards French Polynesia

215
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,094
to protest against a planned French nuclear test when

216
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:48,178
two undercover French operatives secretly snuck on board, planted

217
00:09:48,214 --> 00:09:50,590
a bomb and then blew the ship apart.

218
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,158
The explosions sank the ship and killed

219
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,710
a Greenpeace photographer who was on board.

220
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,626
The French agents were quickly apprehended afterwards by

221
00:09:58,628 --> 00:10:01,042
the New Zealand police and were each sentenced

222
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,078
to ten years in prison for manslaughter.

223
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,786
They would ultimately only serve for two years

224
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:09,126
before being freed by the French government.

225
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,450
Many political figures, especially in New Zealand, have

226
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,222
consistently referred to the action ever since as

227
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:18,766
an incident of French state sponsored terrorism.

228
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:21,982
And France would ultimately agree to pay 816

229
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:24,978
million dollars in damages to Greenpeace, along with

230
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,486
six $5 million to the New Zealand government

231
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,886
as an apology, and a further half a

232
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:31,722
million dollars to the photographer's family.

233
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:35,314
As compensation, France would continue testing nuclear weapons

234
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:39,522
in Polynesia for eleven more years, until 1996,

235
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:41,662
the year of their final detonation.

236
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:44,298
And ever since, they've switched to using computer

237
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,746
simulations for their nuclear weapons testing instead.

238
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:50,542
And today, France maintains an arsenal of approximately

239
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:54,342
300 nuclear weapons, the third largest arsenal in

240
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:57,106
the world after the United States and Russia.

241
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,774
So that was one reason that France

242
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,634
kept much of their overseas empire.

243
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:04,542
But overall, the biggest reason why France maintains the

244
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:07,998
overseas empire up to the present is because of

245
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:10,870
the control that it gives France and the European

246
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,242
Union as a proxy over the world's oceans.

247
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:16,510
You see, under the terms of the United Nations

248
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,018
Convention on the Law of the Sea, or Unclose,

249
00:11:19,114 --> 00:11:22,590
any country may claim an exclusive economic zone, or

250
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,014
EEZ, of the water surrounding their sovereign coastline.

251
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,534
The country making the claim retains the sole

252
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:31,990
and exclusive legal authority for all fishing, drilling,

253
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,786
mining and all other economic activities.

254
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:37,774
And because of their hundreds of islands and territories

255
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,918
that are scattered across all the corners of the

256
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:44,806
Earth, france actually possesses the modern world's largest EEZ

257
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:49,158
and therefore the largest maritime territory of any 21st

258
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:51,726
century nation, ahead of even the United States.

259
00:11:51,788 --> 00:11:52,774
And Australia.

260
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:57,958
France's EEZ spans nearly eleven 7 million ocean

261
00:11:57,994 --> 00:12:00,094
across the Bay of Biscay, the Indian Ocean,

262
00:12:00,142 --> 00:12:03,426
while almost completely surrounding Madagascar, huge blotches of

263
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,514
the Pacific Ocean, and even a tiny little

264
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,618
sliver here, just south of Canada.

265
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:10,362
These small islands are St Pierre and Microsoft, and

266
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:13,030
despite being located right next to Newfoundland in Canada,

267
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,126
they're a part of France and home to more

268
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:18,562
than 60 French citizens who all use Euros.

269
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:21,702
They are the small final remaining vestiges of

270
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:24,202
the old colonial new France in the Americas,

271
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,766
and they have a fascinating history of control.

272
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:28,974
When France was defeated in the Seven Years War

273
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:32,034
back in 1763, they were forced to cede all

274
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:34,270
of their North American possessions over to the British.

275
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,974
But since the British continued to grant

276
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,870
the French fishing rights along the Newfoundland

277
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,702
coast, they allowed them to keep the

278
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,998
tiny islands as a little fishing outpost.

279
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,226
When France supported America during the American

280
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:47,202
Revolution, burton invaded the islands, raised the

281
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,810
settlement, and exiled the entire French population

282
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,190
back to European France.

283
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,722
Out of spite, Burton tried to bring in British

284
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:56,398
settlers to repopulate the islands, but then the French

285
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:58,354
came back and sacked the British colony.

286
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,162
Eventually, the British gave the islands back

287
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:02,022
to France once again in 18 two.

288
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:05,098
But then after war with Napoleon erupted, they reoccupied

289
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,158
them again the very next year in 18 three.

290
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,774
When the Napoleonic Wars were concluded eleven years later,

291
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,802
in 1814, the British once again gave the islands

292
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,162
back to France, but then occupied them again in

293
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:18,190
1815, when Napoleon briefly returned to power in France,

294
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,322
and then gave them back to France yet again

295
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:23,178
after he was defeated after Waterloo for good, and

296
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,062
they've been French ever since.

297
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:27,498
During the First World War, all of the men

298
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:30,282
on the islands were drafted, and about 400 went

299
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:32,086
on to serve on the Western Front in Europe,

300
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,282
where a quarter of them would die.

301
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,462
When the topic of EEZ came up in the

302
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:40,002
1970s, france initially claimed a huge one for the

303
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:44,194
tiny little islands that severely interrupted nearby Canada's EEZ,

304
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:46,710
which led to a very long legal dispute between

305
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,430
both countries over fishing rights.

306
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,838
It was only eventually settled in 1992

307
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:53,718
when France accepted the significantly smaller and

308
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:56,142
narrower boundaries of the current EEZ here.

309
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:59,154
But it's still kind of weird, because now the

310
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:01,926
French control this zone where they're the only ones

311
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,738
who are allowed to fish, and it's completely surrounded

312
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:06,618
by the zone where the Canadians are the only

313
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:07,990
ones who are allowed to fish.

314
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,914
So Canadian fishermen have to always move around it,

315
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:14,106
and local French fishermen are always confined within it.

316
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,518
But when zooming back out again to see

317
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:20,146
the full picture, france's oceanic territory, all combined

318
00:14:20,218 --> 00:14:23,206
across the world, is larger than the entirety

319
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,250
of the European continent itself, and France possesses

320
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,290
8% of the entire world's EEZ areas, despite

321
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,466
the fact that France itself only possesses 00:40.

322
00:14:35,528 --> 00:14:37,890
5% of the world's land, and only

323
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,966
zero 84% of the world's population.

324
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,714
If you were to combine both land and maritime

325
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:46,582
area for every country in the world, then France

326
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,282
all of a sudden ranks as the world's fifth

327
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:53,482
largest country, beating out places like Brazil, China, India,

328
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,734
or Indonesia, which is frankly just ridiculous.

329
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:59,158
And it all gives France and by extension,

330
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:03,994
the European Union an enormous global geopolitical advantage.

331
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:07,174
When also factoring in Spain's, Portugal, the Netherlands,

332
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:11,002
and Denmark's overseas territories, the European Union's collective

333
00:15:11,086 --> 00:15:14,818
EEZ enables it to dominate the entire Baltic,

334
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,794
control nearly the entire Mediterranean and the eastern

335
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:20,878
North Atlantic, and have outposts across every ocean

336
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:22,750
and every corner of the globe.

337
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,134
After the United Kingdom and the United States,

338
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,614
france even further maintains the third largest amount

339
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:32,010
of overseas military bases outside of their home

340
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,242
territory, with bases all across their overseas possessions

341
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,918
in South America, the Caribbean, Indian, and Pacific

342
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,326
Oceans, with even further bases across many of

343
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:42,958
their former colonies in Africa, like Djibouti, Ivory

344
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:46,042
Coast, Cabon, Senegal, Mali, Chad, and Niger.

345
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:48,438
Additional bases across the Middle East in

346
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:51,102
Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and the UAE, and

347
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,470
a final two more inside of Germany.

348
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,378
Altogether, France maintains a force of more than 360

349
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:00,078
soldiers deployed to these territories across the world.

350
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:02,650
And ever since 2001, the French

351
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,442
have initiated military interventions across these

352
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,614
nine countries on two separate continents.

353
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:11,242
The presence of these French military bases and soldiers

354
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,834
all across the world, from South America to Africa,

355
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:16,366
the Middle East and the Pacific, gives the French

356
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:19,194
a very similar capability to the United States.

357
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:21,610
They can project power and deploy military

358
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,118
assets at a moment's notice to counter

359
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:26,614
almost any threat anywhere on the planet.

360
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,098
So when you look at a map like

361
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:30,834
this, you realize that the global French, and

362
00:16:30,872 --> 00:16:34,206
therefore the global European empire is very much

363
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:37,330
still alive and well in the 21st century.

364
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,238
And as a result, France and Europe are probably a

365
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,594
lot closer to you than you may have realized.

366
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,690
But something else you may have not realized yet

367
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,198
is just how much you're probably overpaying for your

368
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:50,274
current cell phone plan and how much you could

369
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:52,018
save by switching over to Ting.

370
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,662
I personally switched over to Ting

371
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:55,590
myself a few months ago. And why?

372
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,934
Well, because of this.

373
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,262
Yep, that's actually a real phone bill that

374
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,194
I received from my old carrier right before

375
00:17:01,232 --> 00:17:02,922
I made my switch earlier this year.

376
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:05,574
But Ting Mobile has three different plans to choose

377
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:07,770
from to make sure that never happens again.

378
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,338
Unlimited talk and text starts at just $10,

379
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:12,646
and then data is $5 a gigabyte.

380
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:15,714
Or you can just get their unlimited plan for just $45.

381
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:18,654
They've also got other plans with five or 12GB of data.

382
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:20,718
But regardless, the point is that you can get the

383
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:23,369
same service you have right now with the same phone

384
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,178
number you have right now for much less money.

385
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:27,377
So if you've ever got a bill

386
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:29,370
like mine, your service probably won't change.

387
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,494
It's pretty much a no brainer, but what should

388
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:33,318
really seal the deal is that when you click

389
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,574
the button that's on your screen right now or

390
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,642
follow the link that's down in the description, you'll

391
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,322
get a totally free $25 credit, enough for an

392
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,846
entire month of service on some of their plans.

393
00:17:43,918 --> 00:17:45,930
And signing up their re helps to support

394
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,574
real life lore at the same time.

395
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:50,280
And as always, thank you so much for watching.
