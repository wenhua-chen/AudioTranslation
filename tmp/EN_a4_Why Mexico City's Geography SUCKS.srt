1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,674
This is Mexico City.

2
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:04,578
It is currently the 6th largest city in the entire

3
00:00:04,664 --> 00:00:08,298
world, with nearly 3 million more people than New York.

4
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,078
And it's by far the largest

5
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:11,862
Spanishspeaking city in the world.

6
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:14,202
Mexico City is high on the list of

7
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,678
the world's most significant, significant and influential cities.

8
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:20,370
But it has one enormous and one very old problem.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,386
The entire city is sinking into the ground

10
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,518
at an insanely alarming rate, with some parts

11
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:29,814
at about half a meter every single year.

12
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:33,142
That is so fast that many geologists have predicted

13
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:36,406
most of Mexico City will sink about 20 meters

14
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:39,126
beneath where it currently stands by the end of

15
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:42,862
the 21st century, with some particularly heavy hit areas

16
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:45,322
sinking more than 30 meters.

17
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,854
Imagine your house sinking 30 meters

18
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:49,422
beneath where it is today.

19
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:52,086
That would be a hole so deep, if you stood at

20
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:54,762
the top and jumped in, it would take about two and

21
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,910
a half seconds for you to hit the bottom.

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,870
Unfortunately for millions of Mexicans, this is exactly

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,106
what's going to happen to them very slowly

24
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:05,218
over the course of the next few decades.

25
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:07,650
And it's all because humans are really,

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,894
really prone to choosing objectively, terrible locations

27
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:12,402
to place their cities in.

28
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:15,466
Mexico City, in particular, has some of the worst

29
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:18,690
geography stats of any major city in the world.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,494
And this is why let's rewind the geographical and

31
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:25,854
historical clock back a little over 700 years ago.

32
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:28,254
Back then, the region's geography and

33
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:30,750
reality was very different from today.

34
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,522
The city didn't exist, and in its place was a

35
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:36,694
large lake called Lake Texcoco, wedged in a large valley

36
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:39,718
surrounded by high mountains and volcanoes on all sides.

37
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:41,850
Legend has it that for 100 years

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,710
before this, the nomadic Mexican tribe awaited

39
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,170
the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy.

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,302
They would eventually settle down and build the greatest

41
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:52,938
city in the world, where the location would be

42
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:56,374
determined wherever they saw an eagle eating a snake

43
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:59,590
in its beak while perched atop a cactus.

44
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,854
Eventually, this prophecy would be realized when the Mexican

45
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:06,754
finally saw this exact vision in the most unlikely

46
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:09,437
of places for the greatest city the world would

47
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:14,070
ever see a small, unpopulated and swampy island right

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,438
here in the middle of Lake Texcoco.

49
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,822
But undeterred by the formidable terrain, the

50
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,982
Mexico kept true to their prophecy and

51
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:22,710
began building their great city.

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,822
And over the next two centuries, this small swampy

53
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:29,506
island was continually enlarged by landfills and floating gardens

54
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:33,282
until it eventually evolved into Tenochtitlan, the capital of

55
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:35,866
the Aztec empire and one of the largest cities

56
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,770
in the entire medieval world.

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,790
By the time the Spanish arrived in 1519, tenochtitlan was

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,166
five times the size of London under Henry VIII.

59
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:47,362
And at the time, considering the Aztecs

60
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,162
position on the Tech tree, the city's

61
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,534
geography didn't actually seem so bad.

62
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,378
Without being fortunate enough to have any pack animals like

63
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:57,558
horses or oxen, and without having discovered any practical use

64
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:00,738
of the wheel, the Aztecs had no other means available

65
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:04,038
to them for transporting goods and conducting trade than by

66
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,914
moving across the water on boats.

67
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:08,386
Tenochtitlan's various canals easily

68
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,790
facilitated this role.

69
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,938
And when you combine that with a complex series

70
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,890
of dams they built that provided abundant clean drinking

71
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,430
water, extremely rich in fertile soil and a highly

72
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,918
defensible position surrounded by a literal moat, it's no

73
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:25,654
wonder that the city became Mesoamerica's most successful.

74
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:28,914
That is, until the Spanish and Cortez arrived in

75
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:33,078
1519, tenochtitlan was put under a brutal siege and

76
00:03:33,104 --> 00:03:36,702
under Cortez's direct orders, the Aztec dams across the

77
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,238
lake were destroyed in order to turn Lake Tex

78
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:42,810
coco salty and deny the Aztecs inside of any

79
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,750
access to clean drinking water without their drinking water.

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,282
And after a virulent smallpox epidemic, the

81
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:51,442
Aztecs inside withered away and the Spanish

82
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:54,786
conquered and subsequently raised the city almost

83
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,790
completely to the ground, brick by brick.

84
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,970
By the end of the 16th century, the

85
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,394
once great city of Tenochtitlan's population had declined

86
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:07,062
by over 90% and atop the ruins the

87
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:10,254
Spaniards founded their new settlement called Mexico City.

88
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:13,078
And this is when the big problems really began.

89
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:15,382
The Spaniards never rebuilt the Aztec dams

90
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:16,878
and dykes and replaced them with more

91
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:19,326
familiar streets and public squares instead.

92
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,270
On the plus side, this allowed them to gradually reclaim

93
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,654
more and more land from the lake to make more

94
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:27,742
space for Mexico City's growing population and buildings.

95
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:30,234
But on the other side, this meant that the city was

96
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:34,098
expanding into a swamp that was surrounded by a lake without

97
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:36,426
any dam to keep out any of the lake's water.

98
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:40,018
Flooding therefore became a constant problem for Mexico

99
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:42,810
City as it expanded and grew, including one

100
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,362
particularly bad case in 1629 when the city

101
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:49,206
flooded for five straight years.

102
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,570
The Spanish Crown even discussed moving

103
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,878
the location of the city to

104
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,638
a bit less geographically problematic place.

105
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:59,286
But evidently they thought eh, they just decided to stay

106
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:02,238
and drain the lake even more and even more instead.

107
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:06,534
Under the Aztecs, Tenochtitlant's population was around 4000

108
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,898
at its peak and was basically just a

109
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,806
small but very dense dot within Lake Texcoco.

110
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,198
By 1900, the population here was actually pretty

111
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:17,562
much the same, but the 20th century would

112
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:21,370
see the city's population absolutely skyrocket.

113
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,170
By 1950 the city had grown to cover 30 sq.

114
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,914
Mi and was home to over 3 million people.

115
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:32,298
And today Mexico City has grown from there to

116
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:36,102
cover an area of approximately three 0 sq.

117
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:39,882
Mi and with nearly 22 million people.

118
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:43,374
This enormous development in just 100 years has

119
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:46,258
effectively wiped out any trace of the former

120
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:48,450
waters of Lake Tex cocoa and covered it

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,022
instead with a lake of concrete and it's

122
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:54,082
wreaked total havoc on the valley's environment.

123
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:55,962
Mexico City is in a region that

124
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:58,738
receives even more rainfall than infamously rainy

125
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,646
places like London or Seattle.

126
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:03,898
But despite that, the city perpetually struggles

127
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,058
to provide enough water for her citizens.

128
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:08,922
Without the waters of Lake Texcoco, the city has

129
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:11,682
been forced to drill deeper and deeper into the

130
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:15,438
belowground aquifers in her ever desperate quest for water.

131
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:18,178
The problem here is that the land beneath mexico

132
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,886
city is an ancient soft clay lake bed.

133
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,142
And as mexico city drills for more and

134
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:25,966
more water, the clay weakens and crumbles.

135
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,978
The water pressure within the aquifer supports the soil above

136
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,914
it, which in turn supports the city above it.

137
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,970
However, as the water is drained

138
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,826
and removed, the soil above compacts.

139
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,802
This compaction, combined with the lower water pressure pushing

140
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:42,646
from beneath, will slowly cause the city to sink

141
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:45,942
over time and rainwater can't easily get into the

142
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:49,134
aquifers to replenish them because the land above is

143
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:53,742
now absolutely covered in the concrete sprawling chaos of

144
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:56,130
the world's 6th largest city.

145
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,458
And as a result, mexico city is

146
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,646
trapped in a vicious geologic cycle.

147
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:02,322
As the population grows, the

148
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,294
demand for water further increases.

149
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,466
But without the waters of the natural lake,

150
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,254
she is then left with no other choice

151
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,822
but to drill deeper into the belowground aquifers,

152
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,762
which reduces the soil stability above and leads

153
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:16,018
to the city sinking even further and further.

154
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:17,982
With the increased development above from the

155
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:20,682
increasing population, rainwater can't get in to

156
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:23,158
replenish the aquifers and the soil's instability

157
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:24,670
continues to get worse.

158
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,050
Climate change even further exacerbates these already dire

159
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,642
conditions, since more heat and more drought in

160
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:34,254
the region inevitably also means more evaporation and

161
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,774
even more demand for the already scarce water

162
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:39,102
supply, leading to even further drilling and of

163
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:40,702
course, even further sinking.

164
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,422
Mexico city of course, knows all of this,

165
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,498
and through a complex series of canals and

166
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,678
pipes, they now import about 40% of their

167
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:51,094
water supply from other regions of Mexico.

168
00:07:51,202 --> 00:07:55,786
However, these canals and pipes are wildly inefficient.

169
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,818
The constantly shifting elevation causes pipes below the

170
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:01,518
ground to routinely crack and burst, while the

171
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:04,630
struggling city government is rarely capable of mounting

172
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,430
any kind of significant repairs.

173
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,498
And as a result of that, for every one gallon of

174
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:12,078
water that is pumped into the pipes of mexico city, more

175
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:14,806
than one third of it will simply be lost.

176
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:17,514
And the energy that's required to pump all of that

177
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:19,698
water up to a city that's a mile and a

178
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:23,394
half high in elevation in the mountains is more than

179
00:08:23,432 --> 00:08:26,098
what the entire city of puebla consumes.

180
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:27,678
A city with roughly the

181
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:29,986
same population as philadelphia.

182
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:33,621
So as a result, mexico city faces water shortages

183
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,994
as if it were in the middle of a

184
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:39,982
desert, despite receiving more rainfall than london.

185
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,610
And there isn't any easy or obvious solution

186
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,842
for them to get out of this.

187
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,338
But the city's thinking problem affects far

188
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,438
more than just the water supply, since

189
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:50,370
it affects some areas worse than others.

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,786
Roads will suddenly buckle and wobble.

191
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,222
Buildings tip over and look

192
00:08:54,236 --> 00:08:55,306
like they're about to collapse.

193
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,598
The metro system in some areas will resemble

194
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,614
more of a roller coaster, while the destruction

195
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:02,410
caused by earthquakes is greatly amplified.

196
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,094
Mexico city is unfortunately located within a seismically active

197
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:08,734
zone and with most of the city's core located

198
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,926
on the weak and sulty clay lake bed.

199
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:13,534
The soil will often behave more like a liquid

200
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:16,218
during an earthquake, causing the buildings above to be

201
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:19,158
even more greatly damaged than they otherwise would be.

202
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:23,002
This is how, in 1085, the Mexico City earthquake caused

203
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:26,610
such catastrophic damage and loss in life to the city.

204
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,598
Mexico City's rapid and unexpected population explosion

205
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:33,526
in the 20th century caused other unnatural

206
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:35,334
problems to crop up as well.

207
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:38,490
By 1992, Mexico City was home to more than

208
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,258
500 industries and more than 4 million motor vehicles.

209
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:45,666
Due to the city's high elevation a mile and a

210
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,278
half above sea level its oxygen levels are 25% lower

211
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:52,246
when compared to a city that is precisely at sea

212
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,458
level and therefore fuels don't combust as efficiently further.

213
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,554
Mexico City is located within a high

214
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:01,386
valley that's surrounded by tall mountains which

215
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:04,410
effectively keeps pollutants and exhaust trapped within

216
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,994
without any place to go.

217
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:09,318
This all meant that by 1992, the UN had

218
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:12,522
labeled Mexico City as the world's most polluted city.

219
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:15,202
But 30 years later, after a variety of methods,

220
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,554
mexico City has managed to get their air pollution

221
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,194
levels down in the valley to about the same

222
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,838
level seen in Los Angeles today.

223
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,458
But air pollution continues to be the 8th leading

224
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:26,430
cause of death within Mexico and causes about one

225
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,950
in every 17 deaths in the country.

226
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,654
For the Aztecs seven centuries ago, settling

227
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:33,498
on an island in Lake Texcoco not

228
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,886
only fulfilled an ancient prophecy but made

229
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:38,418
perfect geographic sense with their understanding of

230
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:40,818
technology and limited population at the time.

231
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,438
In the current day, though, it's one

232
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:45,138
of the worst locations imaginable for the

233
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:48,594
industrialized world's 6th largest city and has

234
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:51,094
caused countless problems for centuries.

235
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:53,758
But it's too late now since pushing Mexico

236
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,530
City somewhere else just isn't really feasible.

237
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,102
Mexico City's countless geographic problems are just a fact of

238
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:02,778
life now and something that has to be lived with

239
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:05,814
because in the end, nature will always win.

240
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:08,754
Mexico's City's struggle against her environment has been

241
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,602
one of the most massive and intimidating projects

242
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:14,398
that humanity has had to have ever undertaken.

243
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:17,070
Maybe you're watching this and you've got your own

244
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,182
project or personal goal that you've been meaning to

245
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:22,174
start recently that you think is similarly challenging.

246
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:24,882
And as a result, you're unsure that you have the

247
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:27,390
skills required to go about doing it just yet.

248
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,602
Whatever it is you're wanting to do, whether it's

249
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,130
getting started, creating your own YouTube channel, making videos

250
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,518
like this one or any other big project, the

251
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:37,018
best place to get started is over on skillshare.

252
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,562
Five years ago, I was in

253
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,362
the exact same position as you.

254
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:41,682
The project that I wanted to

255
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:42,810
start was my YouTube channel.

256
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,618
But I had absolutely no idea what I

257
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,454
was doing or how to even get started.

258
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:49,650
I never went to school for animation or art

259
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,266
and I doubted my abilities to ever create anything

260
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,282
that anyone would actually want to watch.

261
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,778
In the end, I had to teach myself over the

262
00:11:56,804 --> 00:12:00,318
years by watching tutorial videos online here on YouTube.

263
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:03,094
But eventually I got introduced to Skillshare,

264
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:05,142
and through targeted classes like this one

265
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:07,738
called Make Animated YouTube Videos by Evan

266
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:09,714
from Polymatter, who has since become my

267
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,598
friend, I accelerated my learning even further.

268
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:15,918
The classes on Skillshare are from real professionals who

269
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,246
have tons of experience in what they're talking about,

270
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:21,066
who guide you step by step through the process,

271
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:24,126
and all of it is specifically curated for learning

272
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:27,058
without any ads getting between you and your goals.

273
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,190
If you want to start creating your own videos

274
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,554
here on YouTube, the perfect place to begin with

275
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:34,878
would be the class YouTube Success Script, Shoot and

276
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:38,158
Edit with MKBHD, taught by none other than Marquez

277
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:40,702
Brownlee or MKBHD here on YouTube.

278
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,238
Or maybe you just want to improve

279
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:44,490
your own productivity and motivation in general.

280
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,314
My friend Ali Abdull has the

281
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:47,826
perfect option for that as well.

282
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:49,630
With his class productivity.

283
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,598
Master class principles and tools

284
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:52,858
to boost your productivity.

285
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:55,518
But the greatest thing about Skillshare is that when you

286
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:58,054

you can imagine, ranging from animation and graphic design to

289
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:07,218
web development and drawing, any of which can help you

290
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,726
find a new passion, help you get ahead in school,

291
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,178
or give you the skills needed for career advancement.

lot of free time or when you're staying at home.

00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:19,938
And with its varying difficulty levels, it's still

295
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:22,318
great whether you're a beginner or an expert.
