1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,773
California is America's largest,

2
00:00:01,773 --> 00:00:06,561
most influential and most powerful state with a population nearing 40 million people,

3
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:11,349
there are more people living in California than in the entirety of Canada.

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:14,750
And with a total economy size of $3.4 trillion.

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:23,289
California alone would be the world's fifth largest economy ahead of even the gigantic India with 35 times the population.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,649
The two largest engines inside of California that fuel all of this economic and population success are gray,

7
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:33,177
Los Angeles in the south, America's second largest urban area,

8
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:38,821
home to approximately 13 million people and the san Francisco Bay area further to the north,

9
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,938
home to approximately eight million more.

10
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:44,925
These are California's two greatest centers of population and financial power,

11
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:49,987
but traveling between both of them has always been a bit of an ordeal.

12
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:55,948
More than 380 miles away from each other, about the same distance as London is from Dundee Scotland.

13
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:01,875
A typical drive between Los Angeles and san Francisco takes at least six hours to complete,

14
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,354
if not even more.

15
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:05,444
Depending on the state of traffic.

16
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:14,724
The only other real alternative choice available is to visit an airport past their security board a plane and fly the roughly hour and a half journey between them in the sky.

17
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:15,236
Today.

18
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:22,325
So many people choose this alternative that it has become the second busiest flight routes over the entire United States.

19
00:01:22,335 --> 00:01:26,420
Not only are these choices, time consuming, expensive and annoying to many,

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,587
but they're also not exactly ideal deal for meeting California's increasingly stringent emissions targets and that's why beginning back in the late 19 nineties,

21
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:39,692
the state of California began seriously looking into the feasibility of adding in a better,

22
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:43,096
more sensible third option between the city's high speed rail,

23
00:01:43,096 --> 00:01:46,840
which would be a first for the United States On paper,

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,924
the concept would make an enormous amount of sense for the States.

25
00:01:50,944 --> 00:02:03,691
It would provide significantly quicker transportation between the two big cities than driving and was supposed to be a cheaper alternative to fly And with numerous stops along the way that would better connect and serve even more of California's population.

26
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:16,995
The benefits of rapid transit between centers of commerce would be more accessible to more people than ever within the state with profound economic benefits and with more people opting to take the train over flying or driving,

27
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:21,882
California could also work to cut down on their overall statewide emissions as well.

28
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:27,372
The proposal to begin construction on the rail was passed by California voters 14 years ago back in 2008.

29
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:39,629
But the trouble ever since then has been that the project is grinding along at a pace that is now dramatically over budget to the tune of tens of billions of dollars and several years behind schedule.

30
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,539
So what's been going on?

31
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:48,658
Why has California specifically in America in general struggled so much with building a legitimate high speed rail line.

32
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:54,786
While countries of smallest spain have more than 3000 kilometers of high speed rail lines right now,

33
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:56,228
let's get into it.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,106
First of all, let's talk about the facts on the ground within the United States as they exist today.

35
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:05,086
Specifically there aren't really any high speed rail lines in the country yet.

36
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,616
There's technically the Acela Express that's run by Amtrak across the northeast from Washington D.

37
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:09,867
C.

38
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,548
To boston.

39
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:14,730
That features America's fastest train speeds of 100 and 50 MPH,

40
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,177
but only across a small stretch of just 34 miles out of the entire 457 mile route.

41
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:26,799
While most of the high speed part takes place along the 226 mile section between Union State in Washington,

42
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,094
D.

43
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:27,596
C.

44
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,836
And pennsylvania station in new york city.

45
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:31,112
Between these two cities,

46
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:41,564
the Acela Express is capable of running passengers in two hours and 45 minutes while averaging a speed of around 82 miles an hour when factoring in the various stops along the way.

47
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:44,975
While perhaps not exactly what comes to mind when imagining.

48
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:49,604
True high speed rail like in japan or europe, it still beats driving between D.

49
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:49,824
C.

50
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:58,524
And new york by over an hour and it's successfully managed to capture a full 75% of all the and train commuters between the two cities.

51
00:03:58,593 --> 00:04:05,823
The SLS service has proved to be a resounding success for commuter travel in the american northeast and the California.

52
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:10,562
High speed rail project is looking to dramatically expand upon that success in the west.

53
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:16,254
The overall plan as proposed back in 2008 was set to be carried out in two distinct phases.

54
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:19,708
Phase one of the plan would aim to link up san Francisco in the north,

55
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,694
down to Los Angeles and Anaheim in the south via the Central Valley.

56
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:25,553
With 10 additional stations in between them completed,

57
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:41,581
the system would be capable of transporting passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles at speeds of more than 200 MPH in a nonstop time of just two hours and 40 minutes and at an advertised cost back in 2008 of only $50 a passenger.

58
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,657
One way upon this initial phases,

59
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:48,155
completion phase two of the line would commence with further extensions connecting Modesto,

60
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:52,653
Stockton in the state capital of Sacramento to the system in the north,

61
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:54,383
along with san Bernardino, marietta,

62
00:04:54,383 --> 00:04:57,843
escondido and ultimate san Diego in the south as well,

63
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:06,838
fully connecting all of California's most populous cities and regions together by high speed rail capable of moving people anywhere else in the system within hours.

64
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,569
But the benefits would extend far beyond simply moving people across the state quicker.

65
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,673
Back in 2009,

66
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:30,526
the rail authority released projections that the system would ultimately create 450,000 permanent new jobs across the state through the increased rates of people commuting into major cities further away than they ordinarily would have without the rail and for a region like the san Joaquin valley in particular.

67
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,638
The benefits of the rail would almost certainly outweigh anywhere else in the state today,

68
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:42,098
this region is the most impoverished part of California and it's unfortunately been that way for a long time,

69
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:43,458
a largely rural area.

70
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:53,163
The valley is California's most substantial contributor to the agricultural and oil industries and is only a few densely populated clusters of population like Fresno,

71
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:54,714
Bakersfield, Stockton and Merced.

72
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:55,059
However,

73
00:05:55,059 --> 00:06:01,728
six of the counties inside of the valley ranked as the top six counties in the whole state of California,

74
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:10,064
for the highest percentage of residents living beneath the poverty line and they rank even among the most impoverished counties across the entire United States.

75
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:13,959
Of the top five, poorest metropolitan areas in the entire United States,

76
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,196
three of them are here in the san Joaquin Valley.

77
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:21,055
Nearly one in three Children living in the valley are impoverished.

78
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:30,756
The median household income is for 40% beneath what it is across the rest of the state and the situation has been constantly evolving since the 1990s,

79
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:38,293
as the cost of living in the hugely populated geographically nearby urban areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles have skyrocketed.

80
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:46,692
More and more young families and small businesses have been given no other choice than to leave and many of them have settled in the San Joaquin Valley.

81
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,933
Thus, major cities in the valley like Stockton,

82
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:56,521
Modesto and others have become increasing important as commuter cities for working class people into san Francisco.

83
00:06:56,531 --> 00:07:05,822
While Bakersfield has become the same for commuters into Los Angeles and thus the population and real estate values within the valley have been increasing for decades.

84
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:09,651
But the area's transportation system hasn't been able to keep up with the pace.

85
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:15,370
And the California high speed rail project promises to alleviate a lot of these issues in the community here.

86
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:21,567
Not only will it enable commuters to move more quickly to regions with higher paying jobs like san Francisco where Los Angeles,

87
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,660
But it will also bring with it new jobs and opportunities.

88
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,595
And the cities that ultimately receive stations like Bakersfield,

89
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:32,470
Fresno and merced should see increased growth and development prop up around them as well.

90
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,586
And by 2080,

91
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:47,598
the initial projections assumed that the system would reduce auto traffic across all of California's highways and roads to such an extent that it would cut down approximately 400 billion miles worth of vehicle travel within the state,

92
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,548
which would have obvious environmental benefits to boots.

93
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,548
But now, Now, here's the thing,

94
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:59,176
all of this was proposed to voters in the state back in 2008 by the California High Speed Rail Authority,

95
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:04,810
an organization that had been set up by the state government 12 years previously back in 1996,

96
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,781
their proposal estimated a total cost of construction for the project at $33 billion 2020,

97
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,107
just 12 years later,

98
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:20,387
$9 billion dollars of state issued bonds were issued to help fund the project with the rest of the funding expected to come in from the federal you.

99
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:20,466
U.

100
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:20,605
S.

101
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:22,731
Government and private investors however,

102
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:33,356
were obviously now in 2022 more than 14 years after the proposition was passed and two years beyond when service was first expected to begin,

103
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:38,456
what's more the total cost for just the 500 mile long phase,

104
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:58,432
one of the system linking san Francisco to Los Angeles and Anaheim has ballooned nearly threefold from the original sticker price to at least $105 billion now already making it the largest single investment in California history and one of America's most ambitious civil engineering projects ever.

105
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:11,913
And the final price is almost certainly going to be even higher than that because that estimate is based on some old assumptions back from 2019 like an average inflation rate of just 3%.

106
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:16,864
Obviously with annual inflation rates currently running hot at well over 8%.

107
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:31,571
A lot of these assumptions are outdated and the final price tag will almost certainly be higher in the end for context though even with the 2019 projections that is still about 1/5 the price of the entire U.

108
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:31,870
S.

109
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:35,691
Interstate highway system that expands for 100 times longer.

110
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:40,062
Across nearly 50,000 miles throughout all 50 U.

111
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:40,230
S.

112
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:57,870
States and Puerto rico and accounts for a quarter of all vehicle miles driven by all 320 million plus americans but it's not only the costs that have been dramatically scaled up for the California high speed rail since being brought to voters back in 2008.

113
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:04,720
Construction on the system ever since has focused on building out the 171 mile center segment across the central valley.

114
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,836
First they will link Bakersfield in the south with Merced in the north,

115
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:24,037
giving commuters the opportunities to transfer a firmer said onto the pre existing Altamont Corridor express and san Joaquin's Amtrak rail routes to link to either Sacramento or the bay Area and a transfer from Bakersfield in the south on Amtrak's thruway bus service down to Los Angeles.

116
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:24,419
However,

117
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:31,115
even this initial central segment is currently not projected to be completed until the end of this decade,

118
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,346
around 2029 after it's hopefully completed.

119
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:34,031
By then,

120
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:40,187
the next major focus will be on completing the extension in the north towards Gilroy and SAn Jose,

121
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:44,633
which includes the southernmost terminus of the already existing cow train rail line,

122
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:50,105
which will ultimately enable high speed trains to finally run From San Francisco down to Bakersfield.

123
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,150
The full completion of Phase one,

124
00:10:52,150 --> 00:11:06,727
linking San Francisco to Los Angeles and Anaheim is now not expected to be finished any time before 2033 with room for even further delays in the future and that's not to even mention the eventual planned extensions towards San Diego and Sacramento,

125
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:11,134
which at this rate, nobody even really knows about at the same time.

126
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:28,228
The latest figures for estimated one way ticket prices on the system between San Francisco and Los Angeles are from 2015 and we're already inflated up to $86 from the $50 that was initially advertised to voters back in 2008 when adjusted to inflation today,

127
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:33,922
in 2022 that $86 estimate from 2015 is really more like 100 and $5 now,

128
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:41,514
which is very often even more expensive than just taking a one way flight between the two cities would be.

129
00:11:41,524 --> 00:11:43,020
And there have been numerous,

130
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,912
numerous setbacks for the projects that have been causing all of these issues.

131
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:51,022
One of the most significant is simply the reality of California's geography.

132
00:11:51,032 --> 00:11:55,726
There are three major mountain ranges for the rail to eventually cross through,

133
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,532
like the southern coast ranges,

134
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:03,311
transverse ranges and Peninsular ranges that specifically require lengthy and expensive tunnels through active seismic zones.

135
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,020
And moreover,

136
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,255
California has the second highest average real estate prices of any state in the country,

137
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:14,490
making the cost of purchasing and acquiring land for the rail to traverse prohibitively expensive.

138
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:18,646
The project has struggled with acquiring necessary land ever since its inception,

139
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:31,770
but even now there are still more than 200 parcels of land that the railway needs to acquire in order to capture a 52 mile section in Kings County to finish out the Central Bakersfield to Merced segment,

140
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:40,750
which isn't really good for them because construction on this route has obviously already begun and they really need that land at pretty much any price.

141
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,938
And the people who own the land can sell it to them for inflated prices.

142
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,783
And thus, as of 2014,

143
00:12:46,783 --> 00:13:03,287
the World Bank reported that the per kilometer price tag of California's high speed rail system was standing at approximately $56 million which is freakishly higher than in other countries like china where it's more like $19 million or about one third of the price.

144
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:04,502
Even in europe,

145
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:10,927
similar high speed rail projects have only cost between 25 $39 million per kilometer of track.

146
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,518
But the prices in California aren't equal everywhere.

147
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:32,865
Part of the reason why the plan was to build a central segment of the high speed rail first across the central valley in the first place widely heckled as the train to nowhere between Bakersfield and Merced is just because that's simply the cheapest place to actually build out the infrastructure because the land is pretty much just flat,

148
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:37,377
rural farmland everywhere here, the construction figures are more like $11.4 million per kilometer,

149
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:41,245
which is highly comparable to international prices elsewhere, like china or europe.

150
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:51,754
It's only when the rail eventually starts getting into the mountains and The seismically active areas further towards Los Angeles and San Francisco that the price is truly explode exponentially.

151
00:13:51,764 --> 00:14:07,239
And that's leaving a lot of people concerned because the expected funding that was advertised back in 2008 has also been hard to actually come by in the decade plus since with construction costs going up in the subsequent costs and ticket prices going up alongside of them,

152
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:10,464
the rail's competitiveness with airlines between San Francisco and L.

153
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:10,633
A.

154
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:19,163
has been put into question by many private in investors who believe that most Californians will ultimately just continue choosing to fly over taking the rail,

155
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:24,412
especially a flying ends up being cheaper and ultimately ends up being quicker in the end.

156
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:28,000
And it's not just private investment that has been hard to come by either.

157
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:33,572
In 2019, the trump administration canceled nearly $1 billion in federal funding for the railway,

158
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:38,020
citing frustrations over the lack of progress and construction and budget overruns.

159
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:48,808
And last year in 2021 the much more trained friendly biden administration passed an infrastructure bill that granted $66 billion to Amtrak to further develop the S.

160
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:48,948
L.

161
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,048
A.

162
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:54,463
Express in the Northeast and to build out new services elsewhere across the country,

163
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,490
but it didn't include any precisely designated funding for California's high speed rail.

164
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:07,304
Some sources believe that California may only get as little as $5 billion in funding for the project from the bill,

165
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:13,251
which won't really help all that much with a presently estimated 105 billion total price tag,

166
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:23,658
there are grave fears among many in California's government that once the central segment between Bakersfield and Merced is completed at a price tag of around $23 billion.

167
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:32,216
The state will then struggle to find the funding required to finish out the estimated $50 billion leg from Bakersfield to Los Angeles.

168
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:40,187
That requires lengthy and expensive mountain tunnels and the estimated $22 billion lake connecting the central valley to san Francisco.

169
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:45,410
If the tens of billions of dollars worth of additional funding can't be found,

170
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:59,184
California may end up being left with what the critics have been slamming the project for all along an isolated high speed train to nowhere through the central valley from Bakersfield population 380,000 to Merced population 80,000.

171
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:03,136
And since the funding to ultimately complete the project remains too low,

172
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:12,003
the project has been plagued with ineffective management and no clear guidance from the state government on what the project's actual next steps are going look like.

173
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:16,202
And then the covid 19 pandemic certainly didn't do the project any favors.

174
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:24,303
Either construction workers currently employed on the project or at less than half of the numbers they were estimated to be at by this point before the pandemic.

175
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:27,206
Overall, if it's ever finished, the California,

176
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:33,403
high speed railway could provide enormous potential benefits to the millions of citizens of California.

177
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,689
But in order to do so,

178
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:39,481
the project is struggling against the enormous challenges of geography,

179
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:40,619
economics, demographics America,

180
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:46,308
his own cultural and historical preferences for cars and planes, the legal system and more,

181
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:50,480
all of which combined to make the project's ultimate future uncertain.

182
00:16:50,490 --> 00:17:02,168
The success or failure of America's first truly major high speed rail system is literally hanging in the balance and it has a ton of catching up to do with the rest of the world.

183
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:08,573
But to be fair, any engineering project like this has its challenges and if you're anything like me,

184
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:12,480
understanding stem subjects like engine or math have never come easy.
