1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,758
Las Vegas is one of the most

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:03,870
well known cities anywhere in the world.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,942
Tens of millions of people visit it every single

4
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:09,486
year who contribute to making it the third most

5
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:12,898
visited city in the United States by foreign tourists.

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,754
Just behind New York and Miami, las Vegas

7
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:18,178
receives so many foreign tourists that it beats

8
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:21,390
out many other major tourist hotspot cities across

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,694
the world, like Los Angeles, Chicago, Shanghai, Barcelona,

10
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:26,806
Berlin, Vienna and even Venice.

11
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:29,422
In order to accommodate all of these visitors, las

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:34,470
Vegas possesses a truly impressive hospitality arsenal of around

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,150
1500 hotel rooms, which is more than any other

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,866
city on the planet has got.

15
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:43,750
And this is despite the fact that Las Vegas

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,034
itself is a relatively young city, having only existed

17
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:50,718
for a tad longer than a century, and with

18
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:54,774
a relatively small metropolitan population of only little more

19
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:58,314
than two 2 million people, which only ranks it

20
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:01,578
as the 26th largest city in the United States.

21
00:01:01,724 --> 00:01:03,918
But Las Vegas's size and age are

22
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,942
irrelevant factors to the massive volumes of

23
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:10,002
tourists who arrive here every single year.

24
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,690
For them, they almost all come for just

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,154
one single thing vegas legendary reputation as the

26
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:20,314
entertainment capital of the world and the greatest

27
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:22,978
playground for adults anywhere on the earth.

28
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:25,602
Along with Louisiana, the state of Nevada, where

29
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:28,230
Las Vegas is located, is the only American

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,978
state to a fully legalized casino gambling statewide,

31
00:01:32,074 --> 00:01:34,590
which has long caused Vegas to be almost

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,354
synonymous with gambling and casinos.

33
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:40,638
Around eight in every ten visitors to the city will

34
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,938
gamble at one of the numerous casinos while they're there,

35
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:47,694
and at an average of around $600 a person, while

36
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,022
slightly more than half of all visitors will attend one

37
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:52,746
of the many shows hosted in the city as well.

38
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:56,538
Altogether, these tourists visiting the city generally contribute more

39
00:01:56,564 --> 00:02:00,810
than $100 billion per year to the Nevada state

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,414
economy and place Las Vegas as one of the

41
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:05,706
top travel destinations in the world.

42
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:09,509
But the strangest aspect of the city for me.

43
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,974
As someone who spent much of their childhood

44
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:14,262
growing up in Nevada with more visits to

45
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:15,918
Las Vegas than I can even count.

46
00:02:16,064 --> 00:02:19,222
Is the fact that all of this outrageous

47
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,470
entertainment and access for tens of millions of

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,346
people all seemingly exists precisely where it shouldn't

49
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:30,438
in the middle of the driest and least

50
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:34,030
hospitable desert of the North American continent.

51
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,818
The Mojave Desert.

52
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:38,818
This is the same desert that includes Death Valley,

53
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:42,310
after all, the ominously and appropriately named valley, located

54
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,674
just a two hour drive from the Las Vegas

55
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:48,042
strip that recorded the hottest temperature ever measured on

56
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:50,358
the surface of the earth a little more than

57
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,426
a century ago in 1913.

58
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:55,810
At 134 degrees Fahrenheit.

59
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,414
Or 57 degrees Celsius.

60
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:01,530
The Mojave Desert is so dry that the area

61
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,262
around Las Vegas itself only receives an average of

62
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,394
around four inches of rainfall per year.

63
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:12,742
Which is even less rain than Timbuktu receives in Mali.

64
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,602
At the southern edge of the sahara Desert in 2020.

65
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:21,270
Las Vegas set a still standing record of going 224

66
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,558
entire straight days without a single drop of rainfall.

67
00:03:25,654 --> 00:03:29,322
And the reason for Las Vegas extreme dryness is

68
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:34,006
almost entirely geographical the Mojave Desert itself is located

69
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:37,938
entirely east of the towering Sierra Nevada mountains of

70
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:41,070
California with peaks as high as Mount Whitney at

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,474
14 505ft the highest point anywhere in the contiguous

72
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:50,346
48th United States and a mere 85 miles away

73
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:53,842
as the crow flies from the aforementioned Death Valley

74
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,874
the lowest point on the North American continent at

75
00:03:56,912 --> 00:04:00,054
282ft beneath sea level.

76
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:03,654
These towering mountains block most of the moisture that

77
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:06,522
blows into North America from the westerly winds of

78
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:09,282
the Pacific and they therefore cast what's known as

79
00:04:09,296 --> 00:04:12,238
a rain shadow across their east where the moisture

80
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:15,114
coming in from the Pacific fails to penetrate into.

81
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:15,786
Of course.

82
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:19,077
Las Vegas itself is located directly within this rain

83
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:21,510
shadow cast by the Sierra Nevada but it's also

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,282
located within a valley here that's surrounded by even

85
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:26,802
further mountain ranges on every side.

86
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:30,658
Some of which soar up to ten 0ft in elevation

87
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:33,870
and block even more moisture from blowing into the city

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,018
with the wind from beyond and the nearest significant river

89
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:38,794
and source of fresh water to this valley.

90
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:42,978
The Colorado is around 30 miles away from it in short.

91
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:46,258
This valley was never historically a very attractive

92
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:48,654
location to build even a settlement and much

93
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,982
less a modern metropolis of two and a

94
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:53,238
quarter million people and as a result.

95
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,954
It was basically nothing of any more significance

96
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:59,010
than sparsely populated desert for thousands of years

97
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,618
until the very beginning of the 20th century

98
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:04,138
when the city of Las Vegas was officially

99
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:08,314
founded in 19 five and incorporated in 1911.

100
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:11,214
But for the next several decades afterwards, vegas would

101
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:15,966
remain relatively sleepy and quiet until 1931 when two

102
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:19,234
major things happened that would change the region's demographic

103
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:23,514
destiny forever afterwards with a tiny population of only

104
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:28,302
940 people statewide, nevada was by far the least

105
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:30,534
populous state in the country at the time.

106
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:33,598
With less than half the population of the Netsley's

107
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:37,746
populous state Wyoming reeling from the economic fallout of

108
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:40,242
the Great Depression and struggling to find anyone who

109
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,006
is willing to invest in their tiny state economy.

110
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:46,422
The Nevada state government decided on a bold course of

111
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:50,566
action they became the first US state to legalize nearly

112
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:53,562
every form of gambling in order to bring in at

113
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:56,442
least some kind of economic relief to their state.

114
00:05:56,576 --> 00:06:00,958
And perhaps even more importantly, 1931 also marks the beginning

115
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:04,138
of the construction of the Hoover Dam on the Colorado

116
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,642
River just 30 miles away from the city.

117
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:10,038
And perhaps even more importantly, never before in human

118
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:13,410
history had such a monolithic structure ever been built

119
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,202
with concrete thousands of laborers moved in and worked

120
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:20,346
tirelessly for years to finish the job and at

121
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:23,406
least 115 of them lost their lives trying.

122
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:25,518
But with the thousands of new workers coming

123
00:06:25,544 --> 00:06:27,690
into the town for the damn construction came

124
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,646
higher demands for things like entertainment and amenities.

125
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:33,382
And with the recent legalization of casino gambling,

126
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:36,174
the genesis for Las Vegas's status as the

127
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:39,274
entertainment capital of the world was born.

128
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:42,118
When the dam was finished in 1936, it created

129
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:45,270
the largest water reservoir in the entire United States,

130
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,722
just behind it in the form of Lake Mead

131
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:50,958
and granted the southwestern United States the ability to

132
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:54,334
generate enormous amounts of electricity through hydropower.

133
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:57,718
The Colorado River is ideally suited for hydroelectric

134
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:00,546
power generation, owing to its large flow and

135
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,522
steep gradient descending from its source high up

136
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,718
in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado towards the

137
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:09,154
lower elevations of the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts.

138
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,922
With massive volumes of water pumped to the

139
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:14,542
city directly from Lake Mead and massive amounts

140
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,926
of electricity from the dam, investment finally began

141
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:20,914
pouring into Las Vegas and its unique entertainment

142
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:23,262
industry following the Second World War, and the

143
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,690
population began to steadily increase.

144
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,622
By 1960, Las Vegas had finally overtaken reno to

145
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:33,618
become Nevada's most populous city with 640 people, and

146
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:35,886
the population would roughly double from there over the

147
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:40,458
next decade to more than 1250 people by 1970,

148
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:43,318
more people than lived in the entirety of Nevada

149
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:45,238
just 30 years previously.

150
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:48,678
From then, back in 1940, between 19 92,000,

151
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:51,210
the population of Las Vegas roughly doubled again.

152
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,286
And by the close of the 20th century, las Vegas

153
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:57,714
had earned the distinction of being the most populous city

154
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:01,438
in North America that was founded within the same century,

155
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:04,606
just like Chicago had been during the 19th century.

156
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:08,118
But as Las Vegas fortunes and population continued to

157
00:08:08,144 --> 00:08:11,374
soar, so too did the demand in the region

158
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:14,010
for the area's sparse supplies of water.

159
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,242
With its crippling lack of rainfall, the population of Las

160
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:21,754
Vegas and southern Nevada is overwhelmingly dependent upon Lake Mead

161
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,118
and the Colorado River that feeds it from the snow

162
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:28,110
melt of the Rocky Mountains, accounting for some 90% of

163
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,186
all the city's fresh water today.

164
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:32,422
Back in the 1920s, prior to the construction

165
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,710
of the Hoover Dam, the seven American states

166
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,522
that controlled territory within the Colorado Rivers Basin

167
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:40,714
agreed to the Colorado River Compact an agreement

168
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,761
the divided control of the waters within the

169
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,138
basin amongst all seven of the states.

170
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:47,982
The upper space of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New

171
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:50,478
Mexico would be entitled to roughly half of the

172
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:53,554
Colorado River's water, while the lower states of California,

173
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:56,058
Arizona and Nevada would be entitled to the other

174
00:08:56,084 --> 00:08:58,662
half, with nearly 59% of that half going to

175
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:03,562
California, 37% of Arizona and just 4% to Nevada.

176
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:06,258
But the realities of the 1920s were

177
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,922
very different from the realities of today.

178
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:11,074
One of the biggest concerns of the agreement,

179
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:14,242
both then and now, was the expanding population

180
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:18,222
in the southwest, particularly in Southern California, and

181
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:20,802
the resulting increased demand over time for water

182
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,362
in the lower basin states.

183
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,254
At the same time, Las Vegas wasn't even really

184
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,038
a factor at all back in the 1920s, with

185
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,990
a population of less than 30 people.

186
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,402
But with a modern population well in excess of

187
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,414
over 2 million, nevada has been looking for an

188
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:39,658
increased share in the river's water now for decades.

189
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:43,134
But today there are more than 40 million people who

190
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:46,098
depend on the Colorado River for their water supply, and

191
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:49,230
Las Vegas is only a small fraction of that.

192
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,786
And at the same time, the Colorado River's water

193
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:56,274
has actually been greatly over allocated for decades now,

194
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:59,106
because the original estimates of the compact back in

195
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:02,806
the 1920s suggested that the river had an annual

196
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:05,814
average flow of about 17 and a half million

197
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:08,398
acre feet of water that reached the lower basin

198
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:11,098
states of Arizona, Nevada and California.

199
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,394
However, these estimates back at the time were based

200
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,214
on just the past 30 years of records going

201
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:20,302
back to the 1890s, which were all the records

202
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:23,310
that the people of the 1920s actually had available.

203
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,322
And modern 21st century studies of tree rings in

204
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:28,902
the area have revealed that those 30 years of

205
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:32,646
records they used just so happened to probably be

206
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,606
the wettest period in the American Southwest any time

207
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:40,126
in the past five to twelve centuries.

208
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:43,062
In other words, the authors of the 1920s

209
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,962
era compact were grossly misinformed on the actual

210
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:50,350
historical average levels of water within the river.

211
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,414
And more water has been being allocated

212
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:54,258
to the states around it than actually

213
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:57,174
exists within the river almost ever since.

214
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:59,682
And then climate change, decreased rates of

215
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:02,146
snowfall in the Rocky Mountains, and droughts

216
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:05,014
have been making everything much worse.

217
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,418
And the situation has now gotten so bad that the

218
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:12,342
Colorado River today rarely even has enough flow left in

219
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:15,282
it to make it to its natural delta in the

220
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:18,994
Gulf of California in Mexico, where the once rich natural

221
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:22,914
environment has almost completely died there and dried up.

222
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:25,242
This also means that Lake Mead, itself

223
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,502
the source of most of modern Las

224
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:31,554
Vegas freshwater, is rapidly shrinking in size.

225
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:34,986
Last month, in June of 2022, the reservoir hit

226
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:39,358
a new all time low after losing nearly 180ft

227
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:42,102
of depth over just the past 20 years.

228
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,542
If the levels drop by another 100ft,

229
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,698
the Hoover Dam will no longer be

230
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:49,422
capable of producing any hydroelectric power.

231
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:51,402
But as it has always done now for

232
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,930
the past century, las Vegas is rapidly learning

233
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,950
how to adapt to this changing environment.

234
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,834
And fascinatingly, despite being well renowned as a city

235
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:04,686
of tremendous successes, las Vegas is one of the

236
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:08,850
most water efficient cities in the entire world because

237
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,418
they have no other choice but to be.

238
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,374
Remember when I said that Nevada is only

239
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:16,770
allocated 4% of the lower Colorado River's water?

240
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,398
That amounts to just around 300,000 acre feet

241
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:23,070
of water today, which isn't really a lot

242
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,810
when considering the California takes more than 14

243
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,706
times that amount from the river.

244
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:30,270
But the catch is that so long as the water

245
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,558
is returned back to the river, it doesn't actually count

246
00:12:33,644 --> 00:12:36,442
against the state in terms of total consumption.

247
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:39,574
This loophole means that the Southern Nevada Water Authority

248
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:43,830
will usually draw around 4450 acre feet of water

249
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,626
from Lake Mead during a normal year, or about

250
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:49,674
40% more than they're technically allotted for.

251
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:52,278
But since the city is capable of cleaning and

252
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:56,058
returning around 2200 acre feet of water back to

253
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,978
Lake Me during the same year, Nevada's total consumption

254
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:02,706
from the river is usually more like just 2250

255
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:05,998
acre feet and well beneath their total allotment.

256
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:08,634
In order to achieve this incredible rate of water

257
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:11,298
recycling, the city of Las Vegas has enacted a

258
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,998
number of ingenious, policy and engineering decisions.

259
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,586
The city has been designed in such a way that

260
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:20,946
every last drop of water that ends up being used

261
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:25,594
indoors gets cleaned and recycled directly back to Lake Mead.

262
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:29,206
You could quite literally turn on every single shower

263
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,622
and every single sink in every hotel room in

264
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:35,370
the city, and it wouldn't ever consume any more

265
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,782
water because it would all just flow through the

266
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:40,950
city sewers directly to water treatment plants and then

267
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,634
directly return all clean back to Lake Mead for

268
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:46,942
future use and further watering.

269
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,510
Lawns within the city limits was strictly limited

270
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,534
to just a single day a week.

271
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,514
And largely because of its focus on sustainable desert

272
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:58,686
design, las Vegas actually managed to reduce their total

273
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:03,606
water consumption dramatically by 26% over the past 20

274
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:10,350
years since 2002, despite having added an additional 7500

275
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,278
new residents to the total population of the city

276
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:15,286
over the same time period.

277
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:16,594
And they aren't finished reducing

278
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:18,246
their water consumption either.

279
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,706
The first type of law of its kind in the United

280
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:24,906
States, las Vegas banned nonfunctional and decorative grass in the city

281
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:28,866
last year in 2021, to save even more water.

282
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,170
Grass has been getting torn out across city

283
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,398
owned property across Las Vegas ever since, and

284
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,040
it's going to make an enormous difference.

285
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,534
1 grass consumes 73 gallons of water a year

286
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,730
in order to keep alive, while more drought tolerant

287
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,614
desert landscaping only consumes 18 gallons a year.

288
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:52,122
City officials are spending millions of dollars

289
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:54,478
trying to convince current homeowners to tear

290
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:56,418
out their grassy lawns and replace them

291
00:14:56,444 --> 00:14:59,142
with more water friendly desert landscaping options.

292
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:02,106
The Southern Nevada Water Authority believes that these simple

293
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:07,246
landscaping measures favoring sustainable desert landscaping over nonfunctional grass

294
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:10,702
will save around nine and a half billion gallons

295
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:14,502
of water a year, which is nearly 10% of

296
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:16,534
Las Vegas total water supply.

297
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:18,750
In a lot of senses, Las Vegas is

298
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,658
the model city for the rest of the

299
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:24,310
southwestern United States as the region faces increasingly

300
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,658
harsher drought conditions and decreasing water supplies.

301
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:30,894
As the American government just recently issued its first

302
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:34,230
ever declared water shortage for the Colorado River this

303
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,314
year, it has cut water allocations to all the

304
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:41,758
states along the river, including Nevada's, from 300,000 acre

305
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:46,462
feet to just 2790 acre feet, which, when factoring

306
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:48,798
in the rate of Las Vegas incredible rate of

307
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:52,354
water recycling, is still enough to meet current demand.

308
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,174
But for how much longer?

309
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:57,238
Many climate experts are warning that water levels

310
00:15:57,274 --> 00:16:00,474
within the Colorado basin will likely continue to

311
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,674
drop over the next several decades.

312
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:05,514
When combined with the ever increasing demand for

313
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:08,698
water from the still growing population across southern

314
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,582
Nevada, Arizona, and Southern California, the life for

315
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,990
the desert communities here are almost certainly going

316
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,002
to continue growing ever more challenging from a

317
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:20,590
water security perspective.

318
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,490
The fact simply is that in the future, the other

319
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,478
cities of the American Southwest and everywhere else in the

320
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:29,214
world who will struggle with water supplies in the near

321
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:33,258
future should look to Las Vegas for their inspiration of

322
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:37,386
a city well designed to cope with the challenges of

323
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:41,058
21st century climate change in the middle of one of

324
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,278
Earth's least hospitable desert environments.

325
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,762
For if life can be sustained for millions

326
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,126
of people and tens of millions of visitors

327
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,786
here through decades of clever design and foresight,

328
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:55,890
it can also be achieved elsewhere.

329
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,038
Now, a major reason that I was so excited

330
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:00,990
to make a video covering this topic is because

331
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,858
I knew that I could get all kinds of

332
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:07,402
spectacular footage of Las Vegas and the Colorado River

333
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,798
without actually having to go travel and visit them

334
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:13,530
myself by simply visiting my stock footage provider instead.

335
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,550
Storyblocks, without any exaggeration since the very first

336
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,578
real life lore videos that I created more

337
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:22,962
than six years ago now, Storyblocks has always

338
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:25,710
been the first place that I've always gone.

339
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,626
To find footage for all of my videos, they offer

340
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:31,722
an unlimited subscription so that you can download and use

341
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,858
as much as you need for an annual price.

342
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:36,058
That's lower than what many other providers

343
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:38,218
charge for just a single clip.

344
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:41,346
And beyond that unlimited subscription, storyblocks also

345
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:44,662
offers an entirely royalty free library, meaning

346
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:46,218
that you can use anything from the

347
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:49,170
library for any commercial or personal use.

348
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,270
And Storyblocks offers far more

349
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,870
than just footage and templates.

350
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,826
They also provide music, images,

351
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,442
sound effects, and much more.

352
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:58,402
If you're already a creator or you're wanting

353
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:01,230
to become one, I can absolutely tell you

354
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,498
from my more than six years of experience

355
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:06,114
now, as their customer, that Storyblocks is an

356
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,246
absolutely critical resource for you to have.

357
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:11,322
I genuinely don't think I know of

358
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,414
a single full time creator who doesn't

359
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:15,342
already have a subscription with them.

360
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,106
So if you'd like to get started with them as

361
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,938
well, click the button that's here on screen right now,

362
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:23,694
or head over to Storyblocks.com RealLifeLore to sign up.

363
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:27,150
And by doing so, you'll also be greatly supporting my

364
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,006
channel at the same time while you're at it.

365
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:33,120
And as always, thank you so much for watching.
