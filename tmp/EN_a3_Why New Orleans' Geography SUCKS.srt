1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,254
This is the United States.

2
00:00:01,352 --> 00:00:04,042
This is Louisiana and this is New Orleans.

3
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:06,598
And without constant human intervention,

4
00:00:06,694 --> 00:00:09,286
this city literally wouldn't exist.

5
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:13,110
It has perhaps the worst geographic location of any

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,198
major city in America, and there are there are

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:18,858
countless reasons why that are all named water.

8
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,078
New Orleans is a city that is almost

9
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:24,058
completely surrounded by water on all sides.

10
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:26,010
To the north is Lake Pontia train.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,302
In the center is the Mississippi River, and

12
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:30,270
to the south and east is the ever

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,118
encroaching seawater from the Gulf of Mexico.

14
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:36,738
To make matters even worse, 65% of the New

15
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:40,414
Orleans metropolitan area is located either at or beneath

16
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:43,666
sea level, a greater percentage than even the Netherlands,

17
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:46,506
which is only about a third beneath sea level.

18
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,558
This means that when you take a look at New

19
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:51,658
Orleans from the side, it's effectively just a big bowl

20
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:54,462
that's surrounded on nearly all of its edges by water.

21
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,838
And whenever the water tips over the sides from

22
00:00:56,864 --> 00:01:00,190
either the river or the lake, the city drowns.

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,866
And to make matters even more severe, new Orleans

24
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,054
placement directly at the Gulf of Mexico's edge makes

25
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:09,166
it the most frequent target of hurricanes in America.

26
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,190
With an 11% risk of being

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,046
slammed by one every single year.

28
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:15,654
Hurricanes make the flooding problem

29
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,002
in the city even worse.

30
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:18,966
But that's still not all.

31
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,706
Due to a variety of reasons that

32
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,038
I'll get into later in the video.

33
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,978
Louisiana's coastline has been losing the war against the

34
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,654
water for the greater part of a century now.

35
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:31,470
Over the past 100 years, 2000 sq mi of land

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,534
has been conquered by the ocean in Louisiana south.

37
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:36,814
That's twice the size of Luxembourg.

38
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,802
And the ocean's advances are accelerating to the tune

39
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:43,242
of about one football field worth of land every

40
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:48,450
hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

41
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,114
This is putting the ocean and its waters dangerously

42
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:55,842
closer and closer to New Orleans every single hour,

43
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,654
and it's placing the city on a time bomb.

44
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:01,690
Southern Louisiana is slowly drowning.

45
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,034
And it ultimately begs the question, since nature seems

46
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:06,822
to think that settling a city here was such

47
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:11,638
an obviously terrible idea, then why didn't humans?

48
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:14,970
The answer to that is because, of course, it never

49
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,490
really seemed like a bad location until fairly recently.

50
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,874
In fact, for most of America's and even

51
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:24,342
humanities history, the area around New Orleans was

52
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,378
without a doubt one of the most important

53
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:30,402
locations on the entire planet to control.

54
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:31,902
Take a look at the map of the world.

55
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:34,242
Pretend that you've just begun a game of civilization where

56
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:36,534
you're low on the tech tree and look at where

57
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,510
the best locations to build a wealthy city are going

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,626
to be on the North American continent.

59
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:43,374
I would argue for the area around

60
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:46,530
New Orleans being historically the number one

61
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,962
pick for one incredibly important reason.

62
00:02:50,096 --> 00:02:53,590
Despite all the risks of flooding and natural disasters,

63
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,770
new Orleans sits near the mouth of the Mississippi

64
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,310
River and by setting up a choke point here,

65
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,934
one can fully control all of the trade and

66
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:05,610
transportation flowing into and out of it.

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,202
This is vital because by entering the

68
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:10,590
Mississippi here, you can travel throughout almost

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,006
the entirety of the north American interior

70
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,502
by way of the Mississippi river basin.

71
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:18,970
Every single one of these creeks, streams, and rivers

72
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,002
eventually all flow into the Mississippi and find their

73
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,202
way down to new Orleans and the ocean.

74
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:27,094
Until the advent of modern technology like railroads,

75
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:30,094
planes, or highways, it was rivers and waterways

76
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:32,890
all across the world which served as humanity's

77
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,890
high speed transportation and trade arteries.

78
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,490
And the Mississippi is the biggest and the most

79
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,154
important system of them all anywhere on the planet.

80
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:45,210
In fact, the greater Mississippi river basin has

81
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,990
more kilometers of navigable internal waterways than the

82
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,082
entire rest of the world all combined has.

83
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,586
This fact is enormous because it was basically

84
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,270
the world's largest natural transportation system on any

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,786
continent that today flows through 31 US.

86
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:06,406
States and two Canadian provinces.

87
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:10,018
This system literally connected almost the entire north

88
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:13,602
American continental mainland to the atlantic ocean and

89
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,714
the rest of the world from there.

90
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:18,166
And all of it could effectively be dominated

91
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,814
by whoever controlled just this small choke point

92
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:23,902
right near the entrance to the Mississippi river.

93
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:26,266
The french were the first big empire

94
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:29,826
who recognized this area's immense strategic value.

95
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:33,114
And a little over 300 years ago, they founded the

96
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:36,646
small settlement of new Orleans here along the river's curve,

97
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:39,666
where it created a natural levee about one and a

98
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:43,678
half meters above sea level, comparatively higher than the surrounding

99
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:45,438
swamplands that were beneath sea level.

100
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:48,562
The initial small settlement fared well against floods

101
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:51,402
and hurricanes, and a century later found itself

102
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:53,718
under the possession of a new and future

103
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:56,358
global empire the United States.

104
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,434
The Mississippi river and all of its

105
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,766
various tributaries stretching as far as denver,

106
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:03,582
minneapolis, des moines, omaha, kansas city, and

107
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:06,982
Oklahoma city, enabled millions of American settlers

108
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,394
to venture out and conquer the west.

109
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:12,190
And they could reach all of these places via

110
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,418
new Orleans, and all of the goods they would

111
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:17,050
end up producing would flow back to new Orleans.

112
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,758
As America expanded westwards, the Mississippi river became

113
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:23,290
roughly the dividing line between east and west

114
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,022
within the continental states, and the importance of

115
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:28,282
new Orleans became ever more apparent.

116
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:30,858
If any enemy power were to gain control of

117
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:33,354
it, they could shut the entire river down and

118
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:36,402
effectively cut America in half and block all of

119
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,378
the massive volume of trade flowing down it from

120
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,562
the dozens of other states that were making new

121
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:44,514
Orleans one of the wealthiest cities in the world.

122
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:48,394
In fact, by the 1840s, new Orleans was America's

123
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:51,802
third biggest city, behind only New York and Baltimore.

124
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:53,898
And by the time of the civil war, it

125
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:57,534
was easily the south's largest and most important city.

126
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:00,394
River boats and barges easily transported luxury

127
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,514
goods like cotton from southern states like

128
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,230
Mississippi and industrial goods from northern factories

129
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,390
up in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.

130
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,150
And New Orleans was at the

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,734
zenith of her power and influence.

132
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:13,542
But after the Civil War, the

133
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,102
city's fortunes would dramatically reverse.

134
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,042
The invention of new technologies like the

135
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:20,794
railroad introduced new transportation and trade routes

136
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:23,254
that largely bypassed New Orleans location.

137
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:26,542
Down in the southeast, as more and more railroads

138
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,334
and later interstate highways for trucks and cars and

139
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:32,826
airports for planes were built, the crucial importance of

140
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,962
the Mississippi and its various riverways diminished.

141
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:38,958
By the 20th century, the Mississippi no longer had

142
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:41,926
a monopoly on middle America's transportation and trade.

143
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:44,322
And in New Orleans's, monopoly over admits to

144
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,890
that system no longer mattered quite as much.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,094
By World War II, New Orleans had plummeted from

146
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:53,830
America's third largest city to only her 15th.

147
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,418
And despite reaching the height of her population in

148
00:06:56,444 --> 00:07:01,890
1960 with about 6200 people, she was no longer

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,618
even the biggest city in the American south.

150
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:07,362
With cities like Dallas and Houston having passed her

151
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:10,878
up with their much more rapid growth thereafter, new

152
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:14,062
Orleans would enter into a slow and steady decline.

153
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:16,122
With economic opportunity moving on to

154
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,154
other parts of the country.

155
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:20,878
New Orleans lost 18% of our population

156
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,254
in only 30 years, between 1000 972,000.

157
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,290
Faced with a serious demographic crisis like this, the leaders

158
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,914
of the city at the time decided that they needed

159
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,106
to encourage more growth by developing more land.

160
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:37,818
But the problem with that is that New Orleans was

161
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:42,054
founded as an 18th century outpost and its expansion from

162
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:46,870
those borders into a modern, sprawling city was always doomed

163
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,026
to be severely limited by simple geography.

164
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:53,038
As New Orleans developed around her colonial era core

165
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:55,062
that was on some of the highest ground available

166
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:57,762
in the area, she had no other choice but

167
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,814
to expand further into the swampy and flood prone

168
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:04,246
lands that were closer to and eventually even beneath

169
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,282
sea level, which was a dangerous decision.

170
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:09,982
In order to develop the swampland even further,

171
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,018
the city began draining out all of the

172
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:14,578
water, which caused the soil beneath to compact

173
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:17,578
and led to the modern city above sinking.

174
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,902
Today, parts of New Orleans are sinking by as

175
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,610
much as 5 year, and when you remember that

176
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,394
most of the city is already beneath sea level

177
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:29,418
and right next to several major bodies of water,

178
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:34,162
you can understand why this is all catastrophically dangerous.

179
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,049
What makes matters even worse is the fact that

180
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,289
sea levels are only rising as time goes on,

181
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,765
which is making the bowl shape of New Orleans,

182
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:46,446
surrounded by precarious water on all sides, more and

183
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:50,194
more dangerous as the 21st century continues.

184
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,630
With all that in mind, let's analyze

185
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,674
all of New Orleans contemporary geographic issues.

186
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:57,594
First up, Lake Ponter train.

187
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,374
I want you to look at this map

188
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:01,558
of the elevation levels throughout New Orleans.

189
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:03,606
And now I want you to look at

190
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,682
this map that shows the areas with the

191
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:09,450
most severe flooding from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

192
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,106
These really are different maps,

193
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,098
but they look almost identical.

194
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,938
And the correlation is plain to see.

195
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:21,190
When Katrina struck, its powerful winds rapidly

196
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,182
shoved water from the Gulf of Mexico

197
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:26,022
into Lake Ponter train and overflowed it.

198
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,206
The levees that were designed to contain it

199
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,234
were not built up to standards high enough

200
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:33,658
to overcome this, and many failed.

201
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:36,538
As a result, the water spilled into the bowl

202
00:09:36,574 --> 00:09:40,558
that is New Orleans, and the city was devastated.

203
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:44,314
Over 1800 lives were lost.

204
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:48,430
Over $150,000,000,000 in damage was caused.

205
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,370
And because of the mass exodus of refugees

206
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,742
escaping all of the chaos, the city's population

207
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:57,882
was reduced by more than half of what

208
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:01,234
it had been before the year after Katrina.

209
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:04,722
In 2006, New Orleans had been reduced to

210
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,398
a mere shadow of its former self.

211
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:11,214
It was then only the 94th largest city

212
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:13,582
in America, and it was the lowest population

213
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,970
the city had ever had since the 1870s.

214
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,722
Over the years since, new Orleans has managed

215
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:24,618
to admirably rebuild, but her population has still,

216
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:27,610
to this day, not ever managed to recover

217
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,246
beyond her pre Katrina 2005 population.

218
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:35,142
It was a catastrophic blow, but hurricanes and

219
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,266
the lake are but one of the many

220
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:39,274
problems that the city is facing.

221
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:41,970
The next is the Mississippi river itself.

222
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,270
Over thousands of years, the Mississippi's path has

223
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,106
constantly wandered across the landscape of Louisiana.

224
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:50,274
The Mississippi as we know it today has

225
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,966
basically only existed since the middle ages.

226
00:10:53,038 --> 00:10:54,738
And when the French settled the city in the

227
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:58,170
18th century, they weren't exactly aware of that.

228
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,198
Beginning around 1900, the Mississippi's natural

229
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,390
wandering course began to change again.

230
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,754
Had it been left to its own devices, without any

231
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,994
human intervention, the Mississippi would have by now shifted its

232
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:12,226
primary path over here to the Acapula River.

233
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,998
And what remained of the river through New

234
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,198
Orleans would have effectively just become a stream.

235
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,774
In comparison, this would have destroyed New Orleans drinking

236
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,758
water supply and rendered her strategic location at the

237
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:25,822
mouth of the Mississippi pretty much obsolete.

238
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,110
So rationalizing that it would have been pretty

239
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,342
expensive to pretty much abandon the city and

240
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,530
push everybody over to the Acapula river.

241
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,094
Engineers decided instead to construct a massive series

242
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,674
of river control structures further up the river

243
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:40,978
to guarantee that the water would continue flowing

244
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:43,362
into the Mississippi as we know it today.

245
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,714
However, some geologists believe that if a future flood

246
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:50,082
is catastrophic enough, the system could be overwhelmed and

247
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,882
the Mississippi will find its way over to the

248
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,150
ace oflia and around New Orleans anyway.

249
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,742
And the Mississippi poses much more threats to

250
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:59,454
New Orleans than simply diverting itself around it.

251
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,662
Like lake ponter train, the Mississippi also likes

252
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,638
to flood a lot and is higher up

253
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,970
than a significant amount of New Orleans.

254
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,258
So artificial levees were constructed along its

255
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,190
banks to try and contain it.

256
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,278
However, this also had a

257
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,418
lot of unintended consequences.

258
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:16,998
Chief among them was the

259
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,414
destruction of Louisiana's coastline.

260
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:22,726
You see, the Mississippi River is chock full of sediment,

261
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,946
which is why the river always looks so brown.

262
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:28,414
But over thousands of years, the river continuously deposited

263
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:30,898
these sediments into the Gulf of Mexico and compounding

264
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:34,150
over time, creating newer and newer marshlands.

265
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,678
Immediately before the European discovery of

266
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,502
America, this is roughly what the

267
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,938
Louisiana coastline naturally looked like.

268
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,942
But after New Orleans was established and the

269
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:44,962
levees were constructed along the river's banks throughout

270
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,898
the 19th century, the sedimentrich water could no

271
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:50,446
longer reach and replenish any of these wetlands.

272
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:53,158
And when combined with rising sea levels in a myriad

273
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:57,418
of other manmade causes, they began to rapidly shrink.

274
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:00,414
In the past hundred years alone, louisiana has

275
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,310
lost thousands of square miles to the ocean.

276
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,550
And it's getting even worse all the time.

277
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,558
Since New Orleans itself is sinking by about 5 year and

278
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:13,938
sea levels are rising by about 3.6 to 4 year, the

279
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:17,626
water is creeping faster and closer to the New Orleans Bowl

280
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:20,190
all the time over the next 30 years.

281
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,418
By 2050, louisiana is projected to lose about

282
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:28,662
another 5800 wetlands, and the ocean itself will

283
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:30,898
be pretty much on New Orleans'doorstep.

284
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:33,450
At this point, New Orleans will be even

285
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,946
more surrounded by water than she is today

286
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:39,342
on all sides, which will only increase the

287
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:41,718
odds of catastrophic floods in the future.

288
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,838
Historically, Louisiana's wetlands have provided some kind

289
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,894
of barrier of defense between New Orleans

290
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,378
and hurricanes rampaging in from the Gulf.

291
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,850
But in the future, without them, new Orleans

292
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,462
will increasingly experience more and more direct impacts

293
00:13:55,486 --> 00:13:58,602
from hurricanes that right now have an 11%

294
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,774
chance of hitting every single year.

295
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,938
But because of climate change, hurricanes

296
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:05,062
are happening more and more frequently.

297
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:07,158
So the odds of another big one hitting New

298
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:09,570
Orleans are only going up, while at the same

299
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,742
time, her defenses are growing weaker and weaker.

300
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:15,538
With geography abandoning her, New Orleans has been forced

301
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:18,090
to result more and more to higher numbers of

302
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,450
manmade defenses to overcome her now exposed and poor

303
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,842
location, like higher and stronger levees, floodgates pumping stations,

304
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:29,622
river controls, and dredging up new artificial land to

305
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,774
replace their natural wetland defenses.

306
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:34,422
But the really big problem that New Orleans is going to

307
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:37,678
have to overcome is that rising sea levels and flood risks

308
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:41,194
are not a unique problem faced by them alone.

309
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:43,270
But by dozens of other cities

310
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,002
across the United States as well. Such as New York.

311
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:46,558
Miami.

312
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,538
And others who.

313
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:50,410
Because they all have bigger populations and economies.

314
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,058
Will probably be priority targets for any

315
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:54,970
kind of federal flood protection funding.

316
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,366
So in the end, Louisiana itself is one of

317
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:59,982
the most impoverished states in the United States.

318
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:03,778
And without a lot of external federal funding, any manmade

319
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:07,398
structures they build still just might not end up being

320
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:12,022
enough compared with the overwhelming firepower that nature is bringing

321
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:14,962
to the table, say, for taking New Orleans and pushing

322
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:17,974
it somewhere else, like near the Acapellaa, where the Mississippi

323
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:20,862
is bound to probably just end up anyway sometime in

324
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,050
the next 1000 years.

325
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,350
I'm unsure of New Orleans'future and how

326
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,678
long the city has left, which is

327
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:30,970
a tragedy, because I love New Orleans.

328
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,254
But ultimately, in the end, there isn't any amount

329
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,074
of technology that can overcome the simple fact that

330
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:40,282
New Orleans is technically located within a bowl that's

331
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,650
surrounded by water, that's getting deeper and deeper and

332
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,306
even more surrounded by water with every passing hour.

333
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:52,506
New Orleans future is sadly not certain.

334
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:55,554
A couple weeks ago, Louisiana fell victim to its

335
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:59,158
second most destructive hurricane on record, behind Katrina.

336
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:00,930
While the total cost of the damage has

337
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,122
not yet been accurately calculated, it will certainly

338
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,546
be an excess of $50 billion.

339
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:09,630
The storm's devastation left over a million

340
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,274
people across Louisiana without power and brought

341
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:14,346
widespread flooding throughout the state.

342
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,482
And yet the levees of New Orleans held firm.

343
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:20,010
In their defense, a lot of what's happening today

344
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,190
is based on what happened yesterday, last week, last

345
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,786
year, or even last decade and beyond.

346
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,078
Anna's somebody with a lot of family around the Gulf

347
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:30,882
Coast and New Orleans, and as someone with knowledge of

348
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:34,642
New Orleans history and geography, the events of Hurricane IDA

349
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:37,146
had me worried and concerned for days.

350
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,314
But information on what exactly was happening was hard

351
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,754
to come by in the storm's immediate aftermath.

352
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:45,642
I wanted to understand what was happening in New

353
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:48,570
Orleans, a city that's dear to my heart but

354
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,982
not a place I currently live in.

355
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,842
And so I began keeping up with the

356
00:16:52,856 --> 00:16:55,242
events by reading the frequent short articles that

357
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:57,678
were being posted to Morning Brew every morning.

358
00:16:57,824 --> 00:17:00,706
This is what I love the most about using Morning Brew.

359
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:03,358
They're free daily newsletter gets you up to speed

360
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:05,417
on all the current events and news that you

361
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:08,358
need to know in business, finance and tech in

362
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,578
only five minutes, and in a way that's more

363
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:14,202
relevant, informative and frankly, witty than traditional news.

364
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,362
For example, while I was writing the script that

365
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:18,917
relied upon many of the Hurricane IDA articles for

366
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:21,598
context, I also got to read about El Salvador

367
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:25,253
adopting bitcoin as an official currency, how September 11

368
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,762
transformed the American defense industry, and why aluminum prices

369
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:31,350
hit their highest levels in ten years, all because

370
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,662
of a coup and guinea.

371
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:35,058
Since you watch reallife lore, I know that

372
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,958

373
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:40,062
better informed, and regular repeatable patterns of learning

374
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:42,786
are exactly the best way to do that.

375
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:45,474
