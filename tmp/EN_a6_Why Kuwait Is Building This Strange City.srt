1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,670
This is the Sabachi City, an infrastructure project with a

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,618
very unusual approach because in this city, pretty much every

3
00:00:09,704 --> 00:00:13,426
resident has their own private beach access on a lagoon

4
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:16,050
that leads directly into into the sea.

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,822
But constructing such a city means

6
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:22,818
overcoming tremendous engineering problems as project

7
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:25,530
planners battle with forces of nature.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,686
But why did they choose this

9
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:31,820
costly approach of making a city?

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,100
Kuwait in the late 1980s was faced with a problem.

11
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,670
There was a great need for luxurious

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,586
housing in the country, which had become

13
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:03,010
rich through the export of crude oil.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,337
But the small nation lacked the

15
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:07,210
space to meet this demand.

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,678
The northern and southern ends of Great Coast are

17
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:15,778
just 105 miles apart, and by 1989, when the

18
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:17,942
plans for a new city began to take shape,

19
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:21,000
much of the coastal area was already built up.

20
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,294
The capital Kuwait City, with its adjacent outskirts and

21
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:28,642
industrial suburbs, already stretched all the way from the

22
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:31,870
Kuwait Bay to far south down the coast.

23
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,554
Building further inland in the desert is not

24
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:38,666
very desirable for a variety of reasons.

25
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,826
After all, there are no usable

26
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:42,962
resources here to supply cities.

27
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:46,958
The ground is unstable and hardly suitable for construction,

28
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:50,460
and above all, there is an extremely dry heat. Here.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,694
Living along the coast is more desirable as

30
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:57,694
the sea breeze ensures a milder climate, with

31
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:01,750
temperature fluctuations between day and night being reduced.

32
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,126
The idea to fix this is simple.

33
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:10,346
Instead of building directly on the limited shoreline

34
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:13,474
and creating a few new beachfront properties, one

35
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:17,186
could instead take channels that run inland, sneaking

36
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:19,162
through an area in such a way that

37
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,420
there is far more water access.

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,798
If you pull both of these cords straight, you can

39
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:28,730
see just how massively the coast can be extended.

40
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,862
Using this method, two potential project sites were

41
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,046
considered for the construction of this new city.

42
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:38,602
One area adjacent to the Shuwayk district in

43
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,830
Kuwait City, and the other one Alkira, not

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,110
far from the Saudi Arabian border.

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,338
But just before the plans really could take shape,

46
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,540
the entire project had to be put on hold

47
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,810
as the nation found itself entangled in a conflict.

48
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,354
On 2 August 1990, Iraq began invading Korea.

49
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:06,062
With ground troops coming from the border as

50
00:03:06,076 --> 00:03:08,620
well as helicopters and boats from the water.

51
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,978
The Iraqi forces were able to advance to

52
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:15,978
Kura City within just hours, where British citizens

53
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:19,206
in a room overlooking their embassy captured footage

54
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:22,070
of the moment these forces arrived.

55
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,638
What followed was a several month long Iraqi occupation of

56
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:35,394
Korea and the eventual Gulf War that ended with the

57
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:39,500
liberation of the country in late February 1991.

58
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,194
Even if the occupation was overcome, tremendous suffering

59
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:47,370
had happened and there was no money, time

60
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,610
or need for costly new construction projects.

61
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,514
The war also caused massive environmental damage,

62
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:57,514
from a huge oil spill to longlasting

63
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:00,140
fires clouding the country for months.

64
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,414
It ended up taking another six years until

65
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,878
the plants for the Sea City were resumed.

66
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:09,046
And as environmentally destructive as the past phase

67
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:11,934
was for the country, this project should now

68
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,850
focus on dealing well with the environment.

69
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,817
The developers chose the area in Alkhiran and decided on an

70
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,194
approach in which the exact form of the project is strongly

71
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:27,120
guided by the natural forces of sea and wind.

72
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,310
The project's site was characterized by two

73
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,638
existing tidal creeks, with water levels rising

74
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,350
and falling with the tides.

75
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,154
And aside from the Alkyron resort, a popular recreational

76
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:43,930
destination, this piece of land had not been developed

77
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,194
based on the natural currents of these tidal creeks.

78
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,578
A master plan was drafted to create a

79
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:54,850
complex channel system with two additional C entrances.

80
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,510
But as simple as this approach seems,

81
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,810
a number of difficulties quickly became apparent.

82
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,006
One of them is that the water

83
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:06,562
quality could easily become poor due to

84
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:09,386
the lack of circulation in these channels.

85
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:12,874
If the water is not regularly exchanged, this

86
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,802
promotes algae growth, and the channels could become

87
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:19,810
foulsmelling salt ponds unattractive for residents.

88
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,198
At the same time, the water flow flushing

89
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,906
these channels should also not be too fast,

90
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:28,810
because residents are supposed to swim here comfortably.

91
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,718
And how can you be sure that these geometrically

92
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:35,834
shaped canals designed on plan will not be deformed

93
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:38,758
over the years by the powerful natural forces of

94
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,490
the water threatening residential buildings with flooding?

95
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,358
In order to prevent these issues, planners developed

96
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:50,710
a complex computer model simulating the natural currents.

97
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,238
Extensive data was collected at the project site

98
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:58,150
about wind speeds and directions and ocean currents.

99
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,762
With this data, a schematic computer model

100
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:04,814
could be created which simulates the hydrodynamic

101
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:07,020
properties of the entire system.

102
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,606
This way, additional connecting channels were introduced in areas

103
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:14,326
where the simulation showed that the water flow was

104
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:18,778
too fast, because if you introduce another channel, the

105
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,434
water has more space to go, the flow slows

106
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,878
down, and as a side effect, the risk of

107
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,590
coastal erosion is also reduced.

108
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,842
But even though the adjustments based on the

109
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,538
computer model promised improvement, it still appeared that

110
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:36,646
the water exchange was too irregular in certain

111
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,540
areas, which would result in bad water quality.

112
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,342
One possibility to fix this would be by

113
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,330
simply pumping the water out from these areas.

114
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,958
But pumping stations require a lot

115
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:52,558
of energy and are expensive also.

116
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,058
Such a solution means pumping will be required

117
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:57,982
indefinitely, so it's less of a solution to

118
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:01,106
the problem than an elaborate workaround.

119
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,718
Therefore, the engineers came up with another

120
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:06,022
idea that would allow the lagoons to

121
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:09,790
be completely flushed only by natural forces.

122
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,346
They achieved this by strategically

123
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:16,910
placing socalled tidal gates.

124
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,958
These gates are opened up at high tide simply

125
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:24,100
due to the water pressure pushing them open.

126
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,110
However, at low tides, with the water

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,654
flowing the opposite direction, the water pushes

128
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,800
these gates to a closed position.

129
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,714
This way, the system is completely self regulating.

130
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:39,074
And the computer simulation shows how

131
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,838
the flushing of fresh water can

132
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:44,150
be significantly improved using these gates.

133
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,434
While the project was finally beginning to take

134
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,510
shape in the early two thousand s, with

135
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,658
excavators digging the first canals and the flooding

136
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,538
of the first section with water.

137
00:07:56,624 --> 00:08:00,522
Starting in 2004, another project, also

138
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,346
in the Persian Gulf, suddenly attracted

139
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:05,900
lots of attention around the world.

140
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,238
The huge land reclamation projects of Dubai, most

141
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:15,370
notably Palm Jamera, began to take shape.

142
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,566
What was done in Dubai is

143
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:20,042
a very different approach to essentially

144
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,410
the same problem creating additional coastline.

145
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,842
While in Kuwait, channels were dug into the

146
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:30,454
barren desert in Dubai, sand was dredged from

147
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:34,030
the sea floor to create artificial new islands.

148
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,354
There are major differences between these

149
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,178
two approaches, especially when it comes

150
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:41,169
to the effect on the environment.

151
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,078
While in Kuwait, the already existing natural currents and

152
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,946
tidal creeks informed the shape of the design.

153
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,978
In Dubai, the form of the islands was playfully chosen to

154
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:57,010
resemble the shapes of palm trees or of a world map.

155
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,026
And constructing such a land reclamation

156
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:03,910
project involves a difficulttosolve contradiction.

157
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,174
On one hand, the Manmade Islands must be

158
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:09,770
protected from the forces of the ocean currents,

159
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,850
which is done with rigid breakwater rinks.

160
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,694
It's necessary because in the long run, these

161
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:18,958
islands are not stable by themselves, as the

162
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:21,418
shape of coastal land is not formed by

163
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:25,850
chance, but results from complex natural forces, oftentimes

164
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,460
continuously evolving coastal landscapes over the years.

165
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,818
The contradiction is that by building

166
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:36,106
such protective breakwater rinks, this also

167
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,710
prevents the regular water exchange.

168
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,598
For example, while the more exposed islands in

169
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,526
Dubai's, the world project struggle with coastal erosion,

170
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:49,522
the palm Jumera, which is better protected by

171
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:53,470
the extensive breakwater, struggles with water quality problems

172
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,402
as the water in the inner part of

173
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,850
the palm is almost stagnant.

174
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,678
In Kuwait's Sea City, on the other hand, the

175
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:04,798
beaches located near the sea entrance were set up

176
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:07,658
with clearance so that they can be shaped naturally,

177
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,958
while the canals inside the land are not subjected

178
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,670
to the strong ocean forces.

179
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,070
It turns out that dealing harmoniously with nature

180
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,020
was a major focus at Kuwait's Sea City.

181
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,814
While the dredging and creation of land

182
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,934
reclamation represents a harsh encroachment on the

183
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:32,210
speciesrich marine habitat, the digging of new

184
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,826
channels in Karait's arid desert actually creates

185
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:38,800
new additional habitats for marine life.

186
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,034
The stony breakwater in Sea City was only filled

187
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:48,966
with mortar above the waterline, leaving open underwater spaces

188
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:52,120
which offer ideal habitats for marine life.

189
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,138
In addition, mangroves and other plants that can

190
00:10:56,164 --> 00:10:58,974
grow in dry conditions were planted on specifically

191
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:02,222
created islands in order to structurally strengthen the

192
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,970
marine bay and create natural habitats.

193
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,750
Instead of bringing the desert into the sea, krait

194
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,010
Sea City brings the sea into the desert.

195
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,546
Still, the transformation of such a large area

196
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:20,870
was an enormous challenge, and it is intrusive.

197
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,398
Countless hours of dredging were required to

198
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,750
remove material to build the canals.

199
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,950
With the project growing over the years and

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,298
new sections being opened regularly, the planners hope

201
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:39,770
to eventually house 2500 people in this city. Today.

202
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,870
Along the canals, you mostly find residential

203
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,614
villas, high income apartments, as well as

204
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,618
some hotel resorts and several marinas.

205
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:54,102
While many plots also remain undeveloped, if one understands

206
00:11:54,126 --> 00:11:57,470
the word city to mean a diverse coexistence of

207
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,514
living spaces, office space, cultural institutions, as well as

208
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:05,150
public space, this city is not that.

209
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,730
It is a car dependent development that focuses entirely

210
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,220
on private living space with direct beach access.

211
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,266
While they have transformed this area and literally

212
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:19,250
move mountains to achieve this, it appears that

213
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,430
other aspects of modern city planning have been

214
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,230
much less of a priority.

215
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,326
And despite the project being constructed in Kuwait,

216
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:31,142
a country which owes its economic prosperity to

217
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:33,782
the trade with petroleum products, there has been

218
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:36,530
a strong focus on environmental solutions.

219
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,782
Notable also considering that the construction of

220
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:41,474
this project had to be put on

221
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,914
hold during the Gulf War that stood

222
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:47,930
out for its unprecedented catastrophic environmental impact.

223
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,782
When.

224
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,994
Instead of digging artificial canals.

225
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:54,254
Kuwait had to spend about one 5 billion U. S.

226
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,578
Dollars just to extinguish fires all across the

227
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:01,634
country as Iraqi soldiers withdrawing from the land

228
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,998
in the final stages of the war had

229
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,566
set countless oil wells on fire.

230
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:10,650
An act of sabotage with farreaching consequences.

231
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,346
Because once such a fire has been set.

232
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:16,840
It was almost impossible to extinguish it.

233
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,718
If I were to make an indepth video on

234
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:22,782
YouTube about the Gulf War and the oil fires,

235
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:25,638
there's no way it's ever going to be monetised

236
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:28,778
and you probably would never see it. Still.

237
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:31,958
I have made a fulllength companion video explaining the

238
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:35,250
full story of the oil field fires with incredible

239
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,798
archival footage from the time it has become a

240
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:41,174
video I'm very proud of and which I have

241
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:43,154
just uploaded to Nebula today.

242
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:44,270
Where you can see it

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,562
alongside my other exclusive videos.

244
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:49,038
Such as a 3D animated short film

245
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:51,870
I produced about the global refugee crisis.

246
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,858
Or a full length video about the investigation

247
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,770
into the crash of flight MH 17.

248
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,178
And besides me, there is original content

249
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:04,250
from lots of amazing educational creators.

250
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,394
The best way to get all this amazing content

251
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:11,594
is definitely with the CuriosityStream Nebula bundle deal, which

252
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:15,038
at current sales price is less than $15 a

253
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:18,210
year to get full access to both sides.

254
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,718
And CuriosityStream has absolutely incredible documentaries such as

255
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:26,222
Dubai's Vertical City, which covers the life inside

256
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:29,286
Burj Khalifa, the highest building on Earth.

257
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:32,150
So not only do you get access to two full

258
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,074
fledged streaming sites, you also will support a variety of

259
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:40,202
independent educational creators and enable me to make these extra

260
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:42,950
videos that just can't work on YouTube.

261
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,894
So please make sure to do so by clicking

262
00:14:45,942 --> 00:14:48,918
