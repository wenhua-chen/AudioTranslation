1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,340
this is mexico city

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,740
it is currently the 6th largest city in the entire world

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,939
with nearly 3 million more people than new york

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,900
and it's by far the largest spanish speaking city in the world

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,460
mexico city is high on the list of the worlds most significant and influential cities

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,274
but it has one enormous and one very old problem

7
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:25,050
the entire city is sinking into the ground at an insanely alarming rate

8
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,329
with some parts at about half a meter every single year

9
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:40,945
that is so fast that many geologists have predicted most of mexico city will sink about 20 meters beneath where it currently stands by the end of the 21st centery

10
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:45,185
with some particularly heavy head areas sinking more than 30 m

11
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:49,090
imagine your house sinking 30 m beneath where it is today

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,890
that would be a hole so deep, if you stood at the top and jumped in

13
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:56,649
it'd take about two and a half seconds for you to hit the bottom

14
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:59,048
unfortunately for millions of mexicans

15
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:04,890
this is exactly what's going to happen to them very slowly over the course of the next few decades

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,049
and it's all because humans are really really prone to choosing objectively terrible locations to place their cities in

17
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:18,790
mexico city, in particular, has some of the worst geography stats of any major city in the world

18
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,977
and this is why

19
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:25,450
let's rewind the geographical and historical clock back a little over 700 years ago

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,450
back then, the region's geography and reality was very different from today

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,968
the city didn't exist

22
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:34,810
and in its place was a large lake called lake texcoco

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,328
 wedged in a large valley surrounded by high mountains and volcanoes on all sides

24
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,370
legend has it that for a hundred years before this

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,992
the nomadic mexico tribe awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy

26
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:51,209
they would eventually settle down and build the greatest city in the world

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,010
where the location would be determined wherever they saw an eagle eating a snake in its beak while perched a top a cactus

28
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:05,123
eventually, this prophecy would be realized when the mexico finally saw this exact vision

29
00:02:05,123 --> 00:02:09,889
in the most unlikely of places for the greatest city the world would ever see

30
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,930
a small, unpopulated and swampy island right here in the middle of lake texcoco

31
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,250
but undeterred by the formidable terrain

32
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,370
the mexico kept true to their prophecy and began building their great city

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,210
and over the next two centuries, this small swampy island was continually enlarged by landfills and floating gardens

34
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,610
until it eventually evolved into tenochtitlan

35
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:37,407
the capital of the aztec empire and one of the largest cities in the entire medieval world

36
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,848
by the time the spanish arrived in 1519, tenochtitlan was five times the size of london under henry the 8th

37
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,250
and at the time, considering the aztecs position on the tech tree

38
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,169
the city's geography didn't actually seem so bad

39
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:55,050
without being fortunate enough to have any pack animals like horses or oxen

40
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,848
and without having discovered any practical use of the wheel

41
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:06,288
the aztecs had no other means available to them for transporting goods and conducting trade then by moving across the water on boats

42
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:09,407
tenochtitlan's various canals easily facilitated this role

43
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,705
and when you combine that with a complex series of dams they built that provided abundant clean drinking water

44
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:17,288
extremely rich in fertile soil

45
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,967
and a highly defensible position surrounded by a literal moat

46
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,090
it's no wonder that the city became meso america's most successful

47
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,169
that is, until the spanish and cortes arrived

48
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,687
in 1519, tenochtitlan was put under a brutal siege

49
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,889
and under cortes' direct orders

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,127
the aztec dams across the lake were destroyed in order to turn lake texcoco salty

51
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:43,926
and deny the aztecs inside of any access to clean drinking water

52
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:45,650
without their drinking water

53
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:50,090
and after a virulent smallpox epidemic, the aztecs inside withered away

54
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,848
and the spanish conquered and subsequently raised the city almost completely to the ground

55
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:57,330
brick by brick

56
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,460
by the end of the 16th century

57
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,020
the once great city of tenochtitlan's population had declined by over 90 %

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,937
and atop the ruins, the spaniards founded their new settlement, called mexico city

59
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,780
and this is when the big problems really began

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,795
the spaniards never rebuilt the aztec dams and dikes

61
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:19,120
and replace them with more familiar streets and public squares instead

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,019
on the plus side

63
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,379
this allowed them to gradually reclaim more and more land from the lake to make more space for mexico cities growing population and buildings

64
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,540
but on the other side

65
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,427
this meant that the city was expanding into a swamp that was surrounded by a lake

66
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:36,276
without any dam to keep out any of the lakes water

67
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:41,420
flooding therefore became a constant problem for mexico city as it expanded and grew

68
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,620
including one particularly bad case in 1629, when the city flooded for five straight years

69
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,720
the spanish crown even discussed moving the location of the city to a bit less geographically problematic place

70
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:02,050
but evidently they thought they just decided to stay and drain the lake even more and even more instead

71
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,209
under the aztecs,  tenochtitlan's population was around 400000 at its peak

72
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,490
and was basically just a small but very dense dot within lake texcoco

73
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,028
by 1900, the population here was actually pretty much the same

74
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,329
but the 20th century would see the city's population absolutely skyrocket

75
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,930
by 1950, the city had grown to cover 30 square miles

76
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:29,028
and was home to over 3 million people

77
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:36,730
and today, mexico city has grown from there to cover an area of approximately 3000 square miles

78
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,449
and with nearly 22 million people

79
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:47,725
this enormous development in just a hundred years has effectively wiped out any trace of the former waters of lake texcoco

80
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:50,628
and covered it instead with a lake of concrete

81
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:54,100
and its wreaked total havoc on the valley's environment

82
00:05:54,100 --> 00:06:00,129
mexico cities is in a region that receives even more rain fall in infamously rainy places like london or seattle

83
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,009
but despite that, the city perpetually struggles to provide enough water for her citizens

84
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:07,810
without the waters of lake texcoco

85
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:15,278
the city has been forced to drill deeper and deeper into the below ground aquifers in her ever desperate quest for water

86
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,519
the problem here is that the land beneath mexico city is an ancient, soft clay lakebed

87
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,680
at as mexico city drills for more and more water

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the clay weakens and crumbles the water pressure within the aquifer's support the soil above it

89
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,519
which in turn supports the city above it

90
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,360
however, as the water is drained and removed, the soil above compacts

91
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,120
this complexion, combined with the lower water pressure pushing from beneath

92
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,000
will slowly cause the city to sink over time

93
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,319
and rainwater can't easily get into the aquifers to replenish them

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,720
because the land above is now absolutely covered in the concrete sprawling chaos of the world's 6th largest city

95
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,649
and as a result, mexico city is trapped in a vicious geologic cycle

96
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,389
as the population grows, the demand for water further increases

97
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,069
but without the waters of the natural lake

98
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,269
she has then left with no other choice but to drill deeper into the below ground aquifers

99
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,614
which reduces the soil stability above and leads to the city sinking even further and further

100
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:18,910
with the increased development above from the increasing population

101
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,470
rainwater can't get in to replenish the aquifers

102
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:24,310
and the soil's instability continues to get worse

103
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:28,430
climate change even further exacerbates these already dire conditions

104
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,990
since more heat and more drought in the region inevitably also means more evaporation and even more demand for the already scarce water supply

105
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,269
leading to even further drilling and, of course, even further sinking

106
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,069
mexico city, of course, knows all of this

107
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,629
and through a complex series of canals and pipes

108
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:50,750
they now import about 40 % of their water supply from other regions of mexico

109
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,230
however, these canals and pipes are wildly inefficient

110
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,790
the constantly shifting elevation causes pipes below the ground to routinely crack and burst

111
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,069
while the struggling city government is rarely capable of mounting any kind of significant repairs

112
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,509
and as a result of that, for every one gallon of water that is pumped into the pipes of mexico city

113
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,269
more than 1/3 of it will simply be lost

114
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,990
and the energy that require to pump all of that water up to a city that's a mile and a half high in elevation in the mountains

115
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,709
is more than what the entire city of puebla consumes

116
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:29,189
a city with roughly the same population as philadelphia

117
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,189
so as a result

118
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,931
mexico city faces water shortages as if it were in the middle of a desert,

119
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:39,788
despite receiving more rainfall than london

120
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,509
and there isn't any easy or obvious solution for them to get out of this

121
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,788
but the city's sinking problem affects far more than just the water supply

122
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,631
since it affects some areas worse than others,

123
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,427
roads will suddenly buckle and wobble

124
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,950
buildings tip over and look like they're about to collapse

125
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,350
the metro system in some areas will resemble more of a roller coaster

126
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,990
while the destruction caused by earthquakes is greatly amplified

127
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,149
mexico city is unfortunately located within a seismically active zone

128
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:10,668
and with most of the city's core located on the weak and silty clay lake bed

129
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,110
the soil will often behave more like a liquid during an earthquake

130
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,788
causing the buildings above to be even more greatly damaged than they otherwise would be

131
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:26,230
this is how in 1985, the mexico city earthquake caused such catastrophic damage and loss in life to the city

132
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:34,990
mexico city's rapid and unexpected population explosion in the 20th century caused other unnatural problems to crop up as well

133
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:42,830
by 1992, mexico city was home to more than 50000 industries and more than 4 million motor vehicles

134
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,509
due to the city's high elevation a mile and a half above sea level

135
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:52,427
its oxygen levels are 25 % lower when compared to a city that is precisely at sea level

136
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,389
and therefore fuels don't combust as efficiently

137
00:09:56,048 --> 00:10:00,548
for further mexico city is located within a high valley that's surrounded by tall mountains

138
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,629
which effectively keeps pollutants and exhaust trapped within without any place to go

139
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,230
this all meant that by 1992, the un had labeled mexico city as the world's most polluted city

140
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,870
but 30 years later, after a variety of methods

141
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:20,649
mexico city has managed to get their air pollution levels down in the valley to about the same level scene in los angeles today

142
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:28,389
but air pollution continues to be the 8th leading cause of death within mexico and causes about one in every 17 deaths in the country

143
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,879
for the aztec seven centuries ago, settling on an island in lake texkoco

144
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,000
not only fulfilled an ancient prophecy

145
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,480
but made perfect geographic sense with their understanding of technology and limited population at the time

146
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,720
in the current day, though

147
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,918
it's one of the worst locations imaginable for the industrialized world's 6th largest city

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,798
and has caused countless problems for centuries

149
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:56,639
but it's too late now, since pushing mexico city somewhere else just isn't really feasible

150
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,360
mexico city's countless geographic problems are just effect of life now

151
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,440
and something that has to be lived with, because in the end, nature will always win

152
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:13,700
mexico city's struggle against her environment has been one of the most massive and intimidating projects that humanity has had to have ever undertaken
