1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
more energy will fall on the world's deserts in 6 h than the entire world will consume over the next year

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,220
the sahara desert is well known for being the world's largest hot desert

3
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:13,660
but it's probably a lot bigger than you even realize

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,440
it's nearly the same size as china

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,410
it spans across ten different countries in three different time zones

6
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:23,768
and it gets absolutely massacred by sunlight

7
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,289
this is a map that shows annual sunshine hours across the world

8
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,088
there are some notable hot spots in north america, south america and southern africa

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,670
but nowhere gets as much as the sahara desert

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,850
most of this china size chunk of land gets more than 3600 h of sunlight a year

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,649
within that big chunk is this other chunk that gets more than 4000 h a year

12
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:49,929
for reference, that's nearly four times the amount of annual sunlight the germany gets

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,880
most of this is because the sahara desert is a pretty much directly along the tropic of cancer

14
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,798
which means the sun, for a lot of the year, is pretty much directly over it

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,840
and b clouds pretty much never form or even exist over the entire desert

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,400
which means all that sunlight is never interrupted

17
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,140
the sahara, consequently

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,459
is the best location anywhere on earth to play solar panels and develop solar farms

19
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,790
so it then begs the question, what if we covered the entire desert with solar panels

20
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,709
how much energy would we actually be able to produce

21
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:21,590
and how would this change our planet

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,757
let's take a deep dive

23
00:01:23,757 --> 00:01:24,968
for starters, let's begin here

24
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,409
this is the quarzazate solar power station in morocco

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,530
the world's largest concentrated solar power plant currently in existence in a marvel of modern engineering

26
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:43,608
once fully completed and operational, the plant will take up an area of 25 kmÂ² and be capable of producing 582 megawatts of electricity

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,370
it will even be capable of storing solar energy in the form of superheated molten salt

28
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,090
which allows for further production of electricity even into the night

29
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:56,569
after investing more than $9 billion into their solar energy objective

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,209
morocco aims to create four additional plants similar to this one in the sahara

31
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,129
that will collectively create more than 2000 megawatts of electricity production

32
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:12,090
which will be enough to provide for roughly 38% of all of morocco's annual electricity needs

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,530
this project will transform morocco into the world's leading solar energy state

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,810
and as the only african country that currently has a power cable link to europe

35
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:26,650
much of this energy will be exported for profit to the countries of the european union

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,157
but all of this energy is created from just five relatively small plants

37
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,717
what happens when we scale things up a bit and think bigger

38
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:42,650
one of the few organizations thinking about sahara solar energy production in the future is the german energy company deserttec

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,098
which happens to be an investor of the moroccan solar energy project

40
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:50,217
according to their research and data taken from the german aerospace center

41
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:59,068
a solar panel array of just this small size in the sahara could power 100 % of germany's entire electricity needs

42
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,750
an array of this size could power the entire european union

43
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:07,907
while an array of just this size could power the entire world's modern electricity needs

44
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:11,830
at approximately 18 trillion watts, give or take a bit

45
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,870
considering that a typical solar panel generates roughly 350 watts of power

46
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:22,710
this earth powering array would encompass around 51.4 billion solar panels

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,348
and it would be roughly the same size as the us state of new mexico, quite a large amount of land

48
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:36,110
but it's nothing when compared with the vastness of the sahara that also happens to be incredibly sparsely populated

49
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,788
only about two and a half million people live across the sahara

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,318
which means that its population density is on a par with siberia

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,437
which further means that it's possible to set up huge solar farms like this without too much of a negative impact on the local inhabitants

52
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:56,919
the desert tech project doesn't quite intend on transforming the entire saharan into a solar farm

53
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,598
but it's still quite ambitious

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,960
the general idea to set up a series of massive solar farms across the sahara's perimeter and deeper into the middle east

55
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:07,199
once constructed

56
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,560
this collection of solar farms will provide for the majority of africas and the middle east electricity needs

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,960
while shipping any excess power across cables to europe

58
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,439
that could supply as much as 15 % of the continents in higher electricity needs

59
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,600
this is a real life plan that's undergone significant amounts of research and investment

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,600
but why are they only planning on building solar farms around the sahara's perimeter

61
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:31,838
well

62
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,899
while there's lots of obvious benefits to constructing solar farms in the empty sahara

63
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,939
there's also lots of problems

64
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,980
1st of all, the sahara's emptiness itself is both a blessing and a curse

65
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:47,139
on the one hand, it means that almost nobody will have to be relocated or moved off of their land

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,338
but on the other hand

67
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:55,060
there isn't any infrastructure to actually get the map massive amounts of supplies into place in any kind of cost effective manner

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
i mean, look at this map

69
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,620
there's only like four roads that even stretch across the sahara from the north to the south

70
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,540
there are huge empty pockets of land across the desert without a single road at all

71
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,899
and some of these areas, like this northwestern pocket of chad

72
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,860
are more than 600 km kilometers away from the nearest road

73
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:21,819
transporting billions of solar panels to a remote area like this will necessitate building countless new expensive highways or railroads to get them there

74
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,278
and that's why desert tech is only planning on constructing plants around the sahara

75
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,620
but let's forget all of that for a moment

76
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,540
and just think about the cost of the solar panels themselves in a sahara sized array

77
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:41,399
a pretty average 350 watt solar panel typically cost anywhere between $250 and $450 once fully installed on a residential roof

78
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,560
today

79
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,740
since we know that it's going to be expensive transporting and installing all of them in the middle of one of the world's most remote locations

80
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:56,300
we're going to stick with the high cost estimate here and tack on an additional $300 for delivery and infrastructure fees and 250 more dollars for installation fees

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,139
conveniently, this math makes the total cost for each 350 watt panel exactly $1000

82
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,139
so from there

83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:12,338
you can figure out pretty quickly that the 51.4 billion solar panels needed to fit inside of our new mexico sized array that will power the entire planet cost a cool $51.4 trillion

84
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,420
for reference, that's approximately 60 % of the entire world's gdp

85
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,720
but it would enable us to immediately switch all of our electricity over to renewable solar

86
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,819
so that's pretty cool

87
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,509
all right, then now let's just assume that we've turned on infinite money

88
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:35,069
and we expanded upon this by filling up the entire sahara desert with solar panels

89
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,420
what is going to happen now

90
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,420
well, for starters, if we assume that the solar panels are 100 % efficient

91
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:50,620
the entire sahara desert will probably now be producing somewhere around the neighborhood of 1.3 million terawatt hours of electricity per year

92
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,420
so to put that number in a perspective

93
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:01,459
the entire contemporary human species consumed about 173000 terawatt hours of energy in 2019

94
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,259
and that's not just electricity

95
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,540
that's all energy consumed for everything we did that year

96
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:19,069
a sahara desert covered in solar panels will generate more than seven times the amount of energy that all of the nearly 8 billion humans of the world collectively consume right now

97
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:24,519
obviously, this would present revolutionary changes to what mankind could be capable of

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,278
and not just even closer to a type one cardishev style civilization

99
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:37,500
but this overwhelming power given to humanity by harnessing the entire sahara would also come with some significant costs

100
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,240
the black surfaces of the solar panels dotting the sahara will of course absorb most of the sunlight hitting the sahara

101
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,980
only a tiny fraction of that incoming energy will actually be converted into electricity

102
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,860
while the overwhelming majority will be returned back to the environment as heat

103
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:53,778
in turn

104
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:03,500
this heat will trigger a sort of feedback loop in which the heat amid by the solar panels would create a steep temperature differential between the land and the surrounding oceans

105
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,620
this will ultimately lower the surface air pressure and cause moist air to rise and condens into clouds and rain across the desert

106
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,709
so by covering the entire sahara with solar panels

107
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:21,990
will also unwittingly be terraforming the desert sahara into a green sahara at the same time

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,338
in some ways, this will be good

109
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,220
because it will open up a massive amount of land the size of china to colonization

110
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,298
human settlement, and, critically, for the emerging economies of north africa

111
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,580
extensive economic development for their countries and their people

112
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,668
but in other ways, this will be really bad

113
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:39,389
the amazon rainforest

114
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:46,269
over in south america is extensively fed and fertilized by dust coming over from the sahara that gets blown across the atlantic

115
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,870
while the atlantic ecosystems themselves also benefit from this fertile dust as well

116
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,639
removing all of the sands of the sahara desert could create a cascade of unforeseen events

117
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,210
that could wipe out entire ecosystems in the atlantic, the amazon and probably beyond

118
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,850
and create an epic climate catastrophe, the likes we have never seen before

119
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:09,820
in summary, covering the entire sahara with solar panels would be epic

120
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,220
but it's also not feasible

121
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:12,860
it's probably pretty dangerous
