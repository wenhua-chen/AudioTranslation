1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,166
venice is one of the world's most wellknown and visited cities with over five and a half million tourists who visited and stayed the night in 2019

2
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:11,721
venice received 21 times as many tourists as their native population

3
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:15,429
and despite only being home to about 260,000 people

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:19,053
about the same number as live in lubbock, texas

5
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:23,483
venice is visited more often than cities that are significantly larger

6
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:26,300
like moscow, madrid, munich, johannesburg or toronto

7
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:31,675
to put it into another perspective, during 2019, the city of venice

8
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:35,201
with a population that's not even 260000 people

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:42,256
received 86% of the same number of overnight tourists as the entire country of brazil did

10
00:00:42,256 --> 00:00:45,341
with a population of over 212,000,000 people

11
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:51,368
there's just something magical about this small city that's captured the imagination of generations across centuries

12
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,399
perhaps it's the fact that even now, in the 21st century

13
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:04,992
it's remained the final large urban environment in europe that has survived without cars or trucks and has continued to rely instead upon simple walking and boats

14
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:07,480
as they have for thousands of years

15
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:16,352
or perhaps it's the sheer and ancient beauty of the canals and buildings themselves in the city that many consider to be a living museum

16
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:21,245
full of masterpieces from a bygone era that still speak to our souls today

17
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:27,762
but unfortunately, both for venice and the world, venice has two massive problems

18
00:01:27,956 --> 00:01:29,777
the entire city is drowning

19
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:33,105
and too many people are coming to watch it die

20
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:39,534
these are all video clips that have been taken just in the past few years of a city at war with water

21
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:43,054
and the water has been getting stronger and stronger

22
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:47,274
recently, venice has been getting flooded more than 60 times a year

23
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,625
and during the worst of these floods

24
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:54,453
as much as 80% of the entire city could find itself a little bit underwater

25
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:57,474
and then there's the number of people coming to see it

26
00:01:57,572 --> 00:02:00,602
before the pandemic shut the world down in 2020

27
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:04,269
2019 was the peak year for tourism in venice

28
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:10,620
while five and a half million tourists visited and actually spent at least one night within the city that year

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,358
19 million more tourists visited and spent less than a day there

30
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:17,205
and venice itself is really tiny

31
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:24,126
it's only about 5 kmÂ² in area, with nearly 26 million people visiting in a single year

32
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:27,449
that means that at any given time in 2019

33
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,722
there was nearly one tourist for every three residents in the city

34
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:36,151
these problems have been getting worse and worse every year now for decades

35
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:42,730
but in order to fully understand why this is happening now and what's being done to save the city

36
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,798
you've got to understand some of the city's history

37
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:46,882
first of all

38
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:54,394
the strategic location of venice on an island in the center of a lagoon has long offered its security and protection from outside powers

39
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:56,325
before the fifth century ad

40
00:02:56,325 --> 00:03:01,437
the lagoon itself was a relatively isolated and swampy backwater of the roman empire

41
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:05,794
but when the huns and germanic peoples began their invasions of the italian peninsula

42
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:09,234
it generated one of the ancient world's greatest refugee crises

43
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:15,705
and many of these refugees sought the precious safety that was offered inside of the venetian lagoon

44
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:20,865
the lagoon is the largest wetland or marshy environment found anywhere around the mediterranean sea

45
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:31,711
and the dozens of islands scattered across it that rise above the shallow water offered immensely valuable protection across the water from the marauding bands of germans and huns back over on the mainland

46
00:03:31,822 --> 00:03:32,932
and over time

47
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:39,978
the lagoon itself would become the wellprotected cradle for one of the most powerful and influential civilizations in history

48
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:42,313
proud of these islands

49
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:49,437
gradually evolved the absurdly rich venetian republic and her massive maritime commercial empire

50
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:54,967
the lagoon itself offers multiple advantages for the home base of a maritimebased civilization

51
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:01,038
the waters around the city provide a natural moat that any would be invaders have to successfully cross first

52
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:01,531
further

53
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:11,270
the waters around the city inside of the lagoon are generally calm because it's a shallow bay that's almost entirely enclosed from the rest of the mediterranean sea

54
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,400
with only these three possible entrances from the outside

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,574
meaning that the lagoon is a fantastic natural harbor for parking ships

56
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:20,014
the position of venice

57
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:26,451
inside of the safety of the lagoon and the position of the lagoon at the very tippy top of the adriatic sea

58
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:33,713
enabled the city an incredibly safe base of operations from which to build ships in peace and from which to launch them out in war

59
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:40,069
this geographic advantage enabled the city of venice, over time to dominate the entire adriatic

60
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:44,886
and from there, over time, the entire mediterranean sea as well

61
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:49,398
eventually, by the 14th century, the city had constructed the venetian arsenal

62
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:51,959
a massive shipyard that at its height

63
00:04:51,959 --> 00:05:00,009
took up 15% of the entire city and was the largest industrial complex found anywhere in europe prior to the industrial revolution

64
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:05,500
by almost independently inventing the assembly line nearly 600 years before henry ford

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,348
the venetians were capable of producing fully equipped merchant or naval vessels at a rate of one every day

66
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:19,545
something that was completely unprecedented anywhere else in the world in the medieval and renaissance eras

67
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:22,644
through this process, granted by their geographic advantages

68
00:05:22,644 --> 00:05:26,725
the venetians eventually assembled a fleet of more than 3000 ships

69
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:30,170
which they at first used to completely safeguard their city

70
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,927
surrounded by a moat separated from the mainland

71
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:37,182
and then to dominate the entire adriatic and mediterranean seas

72
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:40,160
carving out colonies across the adriatic coast

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,990
along with a sizable chunk of greece and cyprus

74
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,586
by dominating the mediterranean

75
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:50,757
the venetians completely monopolized the flow of trade coming into europe from the east

76
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:55,543
and with their interesting location just south of the strategic brenner, passed through the alps

77
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:58,982
they could easily funnel their goods both across italy and north

78
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:02,733
through the mountains to germany and beyond to the rest of europe

79
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:09,350
venice's geography all but guaranteed that it would become medieval europe's principal center of commerce and trade

80
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,257
and it quickly became the wealthiest city on the entire continent

81
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:19,829
but a series of increasingly unfortunate events completely changed the entire calculus of power

82
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,209
first of all, the venetians, all on their own

83
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:29,021
decided to confront the significantly more powerful and rising ottoman empire and lost against them repeatedly

84
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:34,470
gradually losing more and more of their colonial possessions across the mediterranean in the process

85
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:34,959
second

86
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:42,310
venice's strategic location that enabled it to dominate trade from the east was only as good as the knowledge of the world map

87
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,185
and as the portuguese began exploring more and more of it in the 16th century

88
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:50,074
they were able to completely undermine venice's prior advantage

89
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:54,785
venice had spent centuries concentrating on building galleys that were rely upon ores

90
00:06:54,785 --> 00:07:00,449
the perfect ships for moving across the calm waters of an inland sea like the mediterranean

91
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:05,877
but pretty terrible for moving across the unpredictable and often harsh waters of the open ocean

92
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:14,470
venice was unable to adapt and therefore became locked inside of the mediterranean and missed out on the european rush for colonies across other continents

93
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:18,966
and when the portuguese discovered the cape of good hope for the europeans

94
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:23,682
their larger and more ocean worthy ships ended up dominating the indian ocean itself

95
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:29,076
and the trade from the east shifted towards portugal and other powers from there

96
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:33,586
forever destroying venice's prior monopoly and the source of her vast wealth

97
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:36,605
venice's influence waned and waned across the following centuries

98
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:47,838
until venice itself was conquered by the french and then passed back and forth between them and the austrians for a while before finally becoming a part of the modern nation state of italy itself

99
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,329
for more than five centuries now

100
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:57,526
since vasco da gama discovered the cape of good hope and opened up the indian ocean directly to european trade

101
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:01,485
venice has never again managed to regain its prior historical significance

102
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:04,483
and now, today, in the 21st century

103
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:10,625
the city is facing these new modern crises that threaten its entire existence once again

104
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,786
let's begin with a flooding issue

105
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:15,817
obviously, a city that's literally surrounded by water, like venice

106
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:20,766
will have a flooding problem from time to time, much like new orleans in the united states

107
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:24,737
but venice is located in a uniquely flood vulnerable area

108
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:28,692
it's located in the lagoon at the very top of the adriatic sea

109
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:30,564
while the adriatic's long, narrow

110
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:34,413
and rectangular shape amplifies the natural tides moving up it

111
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:41,346
meaning that the adriatic naturally has substantially more extreme tidal events than the rest of the mediterranean does

112
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:46,186
and the adriatic pretty much funneled them all up right towards venice

113
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:46,668
further

114
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:54,725
the strong northbound winds in the area whipping off the adriatic blow directly towards the three connections between the lagoon and the sea

115
00:08:54,725 --> 00:09:00,250
which can significantly slow down or even totally block the water outflow from the lagoon into the sea

116
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,970
and when that happens, the ebb of water is blocked inside of the lagoon

117
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,398
and the next high tide that comes in overlaps with the previous one

118
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:11,408
which just kind of perpetuates this vicious selfsupporting cycle of flood

119
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,859
and to make matters even worse, venice is located atop the adriatic tectonic plates

120
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:20,077
which is currently in the process of shifting beneath the italian coast

121
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:26,408
meaning that venice is naturally sinking and losing elevation in an area that's already highly prone to flooding

122
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,980
but in addition to these natural problems, humans have, of course

123
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,173
been making even more manmade problems for themselves as well

124
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:38,253
had the venetian lagoon simply been left to itself into nature over the past thousand years

125
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:41,677
it probably would have completely filled up with silt by now

126
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:45,725
because of the various major sediment rich rivers that used to flow into it

127
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:49,076
and venice would have been more or less loosely connected to the mainland

128
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:55,985
the medieval venetians were well aware of this problem and unwilling to allow venice's greatest offensive asset to be destroyed like this

129
00:09:55,985 --> 00:10:02,490
they began diverting the rivers away from the lagoon to keep the sediment out and to keep venice enclosed by water

130
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,216
over time

131
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:11,240
this made the waters inside of the lagoon deeper and deeper and increased the scale of venice's moat and therefore increase their safety from the mainland

132
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:15,019
but it also made flooding of the city itself worse as well, because, well

133
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,186
you know, there was just a higher volume of water around it

134
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:19,817
and then in the 19th century

135
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:23,216
the italians built a railroad bridge that connected venice over to the mainland

136
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:29,139
and this was even further expanded in the 1930s by the construction of a road bridge alongside of it

137
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,740
all of which significantly modified the natural motion of the water inside of the lagoon

138
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,677
and in the 20th century

139
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:39,380
the italian government created an industrial district immediately behind venice

140
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,070
and it made the flooding problems even worse

141
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,072
previously to the industrial district's construction

142
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:51,610
the area was covered by several small islands just above sea level that acted pretty much like natural sponges whenever high tides came in

143
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,620
but the government completely destroyed them by filling the entire area in to cover it all up for industry

144
00:10:57,706 --> 00:10:59,697
and to make matters more worse

145
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:06,331
a navigable channel was dug across the lagoon that allowed large modern oil tankers to reach the new industrial district

146
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:10,106
this artificial channel directly connected the lagoon with a sea

147
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:14,022
which obviously didn't exist at the time of venice's foundation thousands of years ago

148
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:20,062
and it's just become another entry point for high tides and storm surges coming into the lagoon from the adriatic

149
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:26,658
modern studies have indicated that venice is still sinking at a rate of about one to 2 millimeters per year

150
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:33,109
and over the past decade, global sea levels were rising at a rate of about 3.6 millimeters per year

151
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:39,474
meaning that venice's actual sea level rise is above the global average because of their sinking problem

152
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:42,835
back when modern flooding records of venice began in 1872

153
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:50,994
there was only one severe flooding event before 1950 in the city where the water reached a height of 1.4 meters above sea level

154
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:53,052
from 1950 until today, however

155
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,480
which is nearly an equivalent amount of time

156
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:59,596
there have been 21 of the severe flooding events recorded

157
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:02,830
with more and more happening every new decade

158
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,418
of the top ten highest floods measured in venice since records began

159
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:08,479
four of them took place in 2019

160
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:12,320
and the biggest of them in november, was so large

161
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,697
it covered more than 80% of the city and damaged multiple cultural heritage sites

162
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:20,129
in fact, the centerpiece of venice, st

163
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:25,000
mark square now regularly floods more than 60 times a year

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,514
which way back in 1900, only happened four times

165
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:32,274
so now, in the 21st century

166
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:40,518
venice's ambitious plan to fight back against the ocean in geography is called the mandy losterer metal hormones system

167
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:40,969
essentially

168
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:48,918
this is a huge system that's designed to hold back the rising tides of the adriatic during high tide in order to better protect the city

169
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:52,701
and after multiple delays, it's finally nearly finished

170
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:59,918
the system consists of several rows of large gates located at each of the three natural inlets that lead into the venetian lagoon

171
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:05,500
with a majority of the gates located at the lido inlet closest to the city of venice itself

172
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:14,590
there are 78 of these gates in total across all three of the inlets that are each around 20 meters wide and up to 30 meters in length for the deepest sections

173
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,976
under normal tidal conditions

174
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:22,004
the gates will remain full of water and rest within their respective housing structures down on the sea floor

175
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,657
but whenever a high tide coming in from the adriatic is forecasted in

176
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:27,307
the lagoon needs to be defended

177
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,096
the gates will rapidly be drained of water and filled up with compressed air

178
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:35,889
so they shoot back up to the surface and then stop the tide from surging into the lagoon

179
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,207
and then, once the high tide is over with

180
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:46,240
the gates will once again be filled up with water and return back down to the sea floor below and allow boats and the natural flow of water above to move about

181
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:56,961
the ultimate goal here is to leave the gates open as much as possible and allow the natural rhythm between the lagoon and the sea to continue and to only raise them up when absolutely necessary

182
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,817
but the system has not come without controversy

183
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:03,658
for one thing, the schedule and costs have been severely overblown

184
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:11,014
when it was initially proposed, mos was supposed to be a ten year project and cost 4.2 billion euros

185
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,673
construction began way back in 2003

186
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:19,158
and it's expected to finally finish only now, at the end of this year

187
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:27,307
in 2021, more than eight years behind schedule and more than 1.3 billion euros over budget

188
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:31,942
back in 2014, 35 people, including the then mayor of venice

189
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:37,961
were all arrested by the italian police on corruption charges in connection with the mos project

190
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:41,143
multiple environmental groups, including the world wildlife foundation

191
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:44,190
have repeatedly made negative comments about the project

192
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:50,993
and while the supporters of mos claim that it will be capable of handling the threats of rising sea levels from climate change

193
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:52,158
many others doubt it

194
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:56,724
while the gates could always just theoretically be raised to block out rising sea levels

195
00:14:56,724 --> 00:15:03,894
they could only do so by raising the gate so often that they probably just end up functioning more as a near permanent wall

196
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,591
by being raised nearly all of the time

197
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:11,144
the lagoon's natural drainage and interchange with the adriatic sea will be completely destroyed

198
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:17,841
and the lagoons surrounding venice will inevitably become just a gross stagnant pool of garbage and algae

199
00:15:17,926 --> 00:15:18,672
unfortunately, though

200
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:23,673
that may be the only possible solution that exists to save venice

201
00:15:23,782 --> 00:15:31,725
it's been estimated before that just a 50 centimeter rise in sea levels will pretty much permanently doom venice beneath the waves

202
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,125
and in 2019

203
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:42,004
the famous ipcc report projected a rise of 600 to 1100 centimeters in sea levels by the year 2100

204
00:15:42,128 --> 00:15:48,052
if greenhouse gas emissions remain the very same as they are today, by the end of this century

205
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:51,673
venice is probably either going to become the 21st centuries atlantis

206
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:57,572
or it's going to be stuck inside of a blocked off and stagnant lagoon that's full of algae and trash

207
00:15:57,682 --> 00:16:02,398
and there doesn't really seem to be many good alternative third choices

208
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,192
and throughout all of this

209
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:10,422
the pace of tourists coming to visit the already drowning and crowded city isn't seeming to go down either

210
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,142
despite the global pandemic

211
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:17,168
with pent up global demand for international travel at an all time high

212
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:24,394
the number of tourists who will visit the city in 2025 is projected to soar toward 38 million people

213
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:28,197
a number that many venetians consider to be grossly unsustainable

214
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,601
that would mean on an average day in 2025

215
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:37,854
there would be nearly one tourist for every two residents in the small five square kilometer city

216
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:47,216
these extremely high levels of overtourism are creating overcrowding and even further environmental problems for the ecosystem around the fragile lagoon

217
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:52,581
the entire city of venice and its lagoon are considered a world heritage site by unesco

218
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,471
and because of its rampant over tourism

219
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:59,480
unesco was considering placing the city on its endangered list

220
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,794
which usually only includes historical ruins in war torn countries like syria or iraq

221
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:07,748
earlier in june of 2021

222
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:17,718
unesco narrowly avoided placing venice on the list because the italian government finally banned the passage of large cruise ships entering in through the city's historic center

223
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:23,034
but that's pretty much just a minor step in solving venice's tremendous problems

224
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:24,307
in the end

225
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:33,991
all of the engineering and policies in the world may not be enough to match the overwhelming firepower that nature is bringing to venice this century

226
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:39,150
i think that ultimately saved for taking venice and pushing it somewhere else

227
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,210
i'm not really certain about venice's future

228
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,320
and neither is anybody else, because in the end

229
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:54,307
no amount of technology can possibly overcome the fact that venice is located on a chain of sinking islands in the middle of a marshy lagoon

230
00:17:54,368 --> 00:18:00,808
and the water that surrounds it from the outside gets higher and higher
