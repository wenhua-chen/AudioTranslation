1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,940
Las Vegas is one of the most well known cities anywhere in the world

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,980
Tens of millions of people visited every single year

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:12,539
who contribute to making it the 3rd most visited city in the United States by foreign tourists

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:13,859
just behind New York

5
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:14,539
In Miami

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,609
las Vegas received so many foreign tourists that it beats out many other major The tourists taught spot cities across the world

7
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:26,289
like Los Angeles, chicago, shanghai, barcelona, berlin, vienna and even Venice

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,489
In order to accommodate all these visitors

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:37,090
las Vegas possesses a truly impressive hospitality arsenal of around 150000 hotel rooms

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,810
which is more than any other city on the planet

11
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:40,530
Planet is gods

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,329
And this is despite the fact that Las Vegas itself is a relatively young city

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,130
having only existed for a tad longer than a century

14
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:56,609
and with a relatively small metropolitan population of only a little more than million people

15
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,130
which only ranks it as the 26th largest in the United States

16
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:09,489
las vegas's size and age are irrelevant factors to the massive volumes of tourists who arrive here every single year

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:10,370
For them

18
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:22,450
they almost all come for just one single thing vegas's legendary reputation as the entertainment capital of the world and the the greatest playground for adults anywhere on the Earth

19
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:26,489
Along with Louisiana, the state of Nevada, where Las Vegas is located

20
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,450
is the only American state to a fully legalized casino gambling statewide

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,730
which has long caused Vegas to be almost synonymous with gambling and casinos

22
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:43,609
Around eight in every ten visitors the city will gamble at one of the numerous casinos while they're there

23
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,769
and bet an average of around 600 a person

24
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:52,209
while slightly more than half of all visitors will attend one of the many shows hosted in the city as well

25
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,109
Altogether

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:05,209
these tourists visiting the city generally contribute more than 100 billion dollars per year to the Nevada State economy and place Las Vegas as one of the top travel destinations in the world

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,099
But the strangest aspect of the city for me

28
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,780
as someone who spent much of their childhood growing up in Nevada

29
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,379
with more visits to Las Vegas than I can even count

30
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:26,740
is the fact that all of this outrageous entertainment and excess for tens of millions of people all seemingly exists precisely where it shouldn't

31
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,659
in the middle of the dryest and least hospitable desert of the North American continent

32
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,259
the Mohave Desert

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,659
This is the same desert that includes Death Valley

34
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,740
after all, the ominously and appropriately named valley

35
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,819
located just a two hour drive from the Las Vegas Strip

36
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,979
the hottest temperature ever measured on the surface of the Earth

37
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:55,259
a little more than a century ago in 1913, at 134 degrees Fahrenheit

38
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,860
or 57 degrees Celsius

39
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:07,900
the Mohave Desert is so dry that the area around Las Vegas itself only receives an average of around 4 " of rainfall per year

40
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,020
which is even less rain than Timbuktu receives in Mali, at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert

41
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:15,939
In 2020

42
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:25,060
las Vegas set a still standing record of going 224 entire straight days without a single drop of rainfall

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,500
And the reason for Las vegas' extreme dryness is almost entirely geographical

44
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,129
The Mojave Desert itself is located entirely east of the towering Sierra Nevada mountains of California

45
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,050
with peaks as high as Mount Whitney at 14505 ft

46
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,530
the highest point anywhere in the contiguous 48 United States

47
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:53,530
and a mere 85 mi away, as the crow flies from from the affir mentioned Death Valley

48
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,930
the lowest point on the North American continent, at 282 ft

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,689
Beneath sea level

50
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:06,770
These towering mountains block most of the moisture that blows into North America from the westerly winds of the Pacific

51
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:15,490
and they therefore cast what's known as a rain shadow across their east where the moisture coming in from the Pacific fails to penetrate into Of course

52
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,490
las Vegas itself is located directly within this rain shadow cast by the Sierra Nevada

53
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,329
but it's also located within a valley here that's surrounded by even further mountain ranges on every side

54
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:34,810
some of which sore up to 10000 ft in elevation and block even more moisture from blowing into the city with the wind from beyond

55
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,610
And the nearest significant river and source of fresh water to this valley

56
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:41,889
the Colorado, is around 30 mi away from it

57
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,850
In short, this valley was never, historically

58
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,689
a very attractive location to build even a settlement

59
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,009
and much less of modern metropolis of two and a quarter mill And as a result

60
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,730
it was basically nothing of any more significance than sparsely populated desert for thousands of years

61
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,370
until the very beginning of the 20th century

62
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:07,209
when the city of Las Vegas was officially founded in 1905 and incorporated in 1911

63
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,949
But for the next several decades afterwards

64
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,689
vegas would remain relatively sleepy and quiet until 1931

65
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:20,370
when two major things happened that would change the region's demographic destiny forever

66
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,290
Afterwards, with a tiny population of only 94000 people statewide

67
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,050
nevada was by far the least popular state in the country at the time

68
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,170
with less than half the population of the next least popular state

69
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,329
wyoming, reeling from the economic fallout of the Great Depression

70
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,529
and struggling to find anyone who is willing to invest in their tiny state economy

71
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,610
the Nevada state government decided on a bold course of action

72
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:56,490
They became the 1st U-S state to legalize nearly every form of gambling in order to bring in at least some kind of economic relief to their state

73
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:57,810
And perhaps even more importantly

74
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,290
1931 also marked the beginning of the construction of the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River

75
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,329
just 30 mi away from the city

76
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:07,889
And perhaps even more importantly

77
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:12,410
never before in human history had such a mono the alithic structure

78
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,850
ever been built with concrete

79
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,569
Thousands of laborers moved in and worked higherlessly for years to finish the job

80
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,889
and at least 115 of them lost their lives trying

81
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:30,129
But with thousands of new workers coming into the town for the dam construction came higher demands for things like entertainment and amenities

82
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,810
And with the recently legalization of casino gambling

83
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:38,689
the genesis for Las vegas' status as the entertainment capital of the world was born

84
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,470
When the dam was finished in 1936

85
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,990
it created the largest water reservoir in the entire United States

86
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,389
Just behind it in the form of Lake Mead

87
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,910
and granted the Southwestern United States the ability to generate enormous amounts of electricity through hydropower

88
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:58,350
The Colorado River is ideally suited for hydroelectric power generation

89
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,269
owing to its large flow and steep gradient

90
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,670
descending from its source high up in the rocky mountains of Colorado towards the lower elevations of the Mohave and Sonoran deserts

91
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:13,149
with massive volumes of water pumped to the city directly from Lake Mead

92
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:22,550
And massive amounts of electricity from the dam investment finally began pouring into and its unique entertainment industry following the 2nd World War

93
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,189
and the population began to steadily increase

94
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,029
By 1960

95
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,910
wats Vegas had finally overtaken Reno to become nevada's most popular city with 64000 people

96
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:39,350
and the population would roughly double from there over the next decade to more than 125000 people by 1970

97
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,949
more people that lived in the entirety of Nevada just 30 years previously

98
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:50,870
From then, back in 1940, between 19 92000, the population of Las Vegas roughly doubled again

99
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,189
and by the close of the 20th century

100
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:58,470
las Vegas had earned the distinction of being the most populous city in North America

101
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,389
founded within the same century, just like Chicago had been during the 19th century

102
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:08,310
But as Las vegas's fortunes and population continue to soar

103
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,870
so too did the demand in the region for the area sparse supplies of water

104
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,750
With its crippling lack of rainfall

105
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:25,269
the population of Las Vegas and southern Nevada is overwhelmingly dependent upon Lake Mead and the Colorado River that feeds it from the snow melt of the rocky mountains

106
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,829
accounting for some 90 % of all the city's fresh water today

107
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,950
Back in the 1920s, prior to the construction of the Hoover Dam

108
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,110
the seven American states, the controlled territory within the Colorado Rivers Basin

109
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,629
agreed to the Colorado River at agreement the divided control of the waters within the basin amongst all seven of the states

110
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,190
The upper states of Colorado

111
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:51,669
utah Wyoming in New Mexico would be entitled to roughly half of the Colorado Rivers water

112
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,070
while the lower states of California, arizona and Nevada would be entitled to the other half

113
00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:03,029
with nearly 59 % of that half going to California, 37 % Arizona and just 4 % Nevada

114
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,049
But the realities of the 1920s were very different from the realities of today

115
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,990
One of the biggest concerns of the agreement, both then and now

116
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,470
was the expanding population in the Southwest, particularly in southern California

117
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,870
and the resulting increase demand over time for water in the lower Basin states

118
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,750
At the same time, las Vegas wasn't even really a factor at all back in the 1920s

119
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,509
with a population of less than 3000 people

120
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,629
with a modern population well in excessive over 2 million

121
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,190
Nevada has been looking for an increased share in the river's water now for decades

122
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,230
but today

123
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,509
there are more than 40 million people who depend on the Colorado River for their water supply

124
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,750
and Las Vegas is only a small fraction of that

125
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,029
And at the same time

126
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:55,950
the Colorado the river's water has actually been greatly over allocated for decades now

127
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:08,990
because the original estimates of the compact back in the 1920s suggested that the river had an annual average flow of about 17 and a half million acre feet of water that reached the lower basin seats of Arizona

128
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,549
nevada and California

129
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:11,409
However

130
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,950
these estimates back at the time were based on just the past 30 years of records going back to the 1890s

131
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,169
which were all the records that the people of the 1920s actually had available

132
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:35,230
And modern 21st century studies of trade rings in the area have revealed that those 30 years of records they used just so what will happen to probably be the wettest period in the American Southwest

133
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,549
any time in the past five to twelve centuries

134
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:40,870
In other words

135
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:50,070
the authors of the 1920s Era Compact were grossly misinformed on the actual historical average levels of water within the river

136
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:57,149
And more water has been being allocated to the states around it then actually exists within the river almost ever since

137
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,990
And then climate change decreased rates of snowfall in the rocky mountains

138
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:04,590
and droughts have been making everything much worse

139
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:16,950
And the situation has now gotten so bad that the Colorado River today rarely even is enough flow left in it to make it to its natural delta in the Gulf of California in Mexico

140
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,389
where the one's rich natural environment has almost completely died there and dried up

141
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,899
This also means the Lake meat itself

142
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,940
the source of most of modern Las vegas's fresh water, is rapidly shrinking in size

143
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:39,200
Last month, in June of 2022, the reservoir hit a new all time low after losing nearly 180 ft

144
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,139
Of depth over just the past 20 years

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,139
If the levels dropped by another hundred feet

146
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:49,179
the Hoover Dam will no longer be capable of producing any hydroelectric power

147
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,139
But as it has always done now for the past century

148
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,700
las Vegas is rapidly learning how to adapt to this changing environment

149
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,139
And fascinatingly, despite being well renowned as a city of tremendous successes

150
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:07,740
las Vegas is one of the most water efficient cities in the entire world

151
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:16,500
because they have no other choice but to be Remember when I said the Nevada is only allocated percent of the lower Colorado rivers water

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,940
That amounts to just around 300000 acre feet of water today

153
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:27,419
which isn't really when considering the California takes more than 14 times that amount from the river

154
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,500
But the catch is that so long as the water is returned back to the river

155
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,100
it doesn't actually count against the state in terms of total consumption

156
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:45,620
This loophole means that the Southern Nevada Water Authority will usually draw around 445000 an acre feet of water from Lake Mead during a normal year

157
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,340
or about 40 % more than they're technically allotted for

158
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:57,259
But since the city is capable of cleaning and returning around 220000 acre feet of water back to Lake me during the same year

159
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,460
nevada's total consumption from the river is usually more like just 225000 feet and well beneath their total allotment

160
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,019
In order to achieve this incredible rate of water recycling

161
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:14,539
the city of Las Vegas has enacted a number of ingenious policy and engineering decisions

162
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,259
The city has been designed in such a way that every last drop of water that ends up being used indoors gets cleaned

163
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,179
cycled directly back to Lake Mead

164
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,899
You could quite literally turn on every single shower and every single sink in every hotel room in the city

165
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,659
and it wouldn't ever consume any more water

166
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,980
because it would all just flow through the city sewers directly to water treatment plants

167
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,139
and then directly return all clean back to lake need for future use

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,600
And further watering lawns within the city limits was strictly limited to just a single day a week

169
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,899
And largely because of this focus on sustainable desert design

170
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:03,700
las Vegas actually managed to reduce their total water consumption dramatically by 26 % over the the past 20 years

171
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,340
since 2002

172
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:14,940
despite having added an additional 750000 new residents to the total population of the city over the same time period

173
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,200
And they aren't finished reducing their water consumption either

174
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,840
The 1st type of law of its kind in the United States

175
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,679
las Vegas banned nonfunctional and decorative grass in the city last year, in 2021

176
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,879
To save even more water, grass is beginning torn out across city

177
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,519
own property across Las Vegas ever since

178
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,600
and it's going to make an enormous difference

179
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,200
1 sq ft

180
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,639
Of grass consumes 73 gallons of water a year in order to keep alive

181
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,159
while more drought tolerant desert landscaping only consumes 18 gallons a year

182
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:58,759
City officials are spending millions of dollars trying to convince current homeowners to tear out their grass lawns and replace them with more water friendly desert landscaping options

183
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,000
The Southern Nevada Water Authority believes that these simple landscaping measures

184
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,799
favoring sustainable desert landscaping over nonfunctional grass

185
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,970
will save around nine and a half billion gallons of water a year

186
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,090
which is nearly 10 % of Las vegasist total water supply

187
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,629
In a lot of senses, las Vegas is the model city for the rest of the Southwestern United States

188
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,110
as the region faces increasingly harsher drought conditions and decreasing water supplies

189
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:33,809
As the American government just recently issued its 1st ever declared water shortage for the Colorado River

190
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,269
This year, it has cut water allocations all the states along the river

191
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:44,870
including nevadas, from 300000 acre feet to just 279000 acre feet

192
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,429
which, when factoring in the rate of Las vegas' incredible rate of water recycling

193
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,990
is still enough to meet current demand

194
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,549
But for how much longer

195
00:15:54,409 --> 00:16:02,330
Many climate experts are warning that water levels within the Colorado Basin will likely continue to drop over the next several decades

196
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:08,850
when combined with the ever increasing demand for water from the still growing population across Southern Nevada

197
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,850
arizona and southern California

198
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:20,250
the life for the desert communities here are almost certainly going to continue growing ever more challenging from a water security perspective

199
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,730
The fact simply is that in the future

200
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:39,049
the other cities of the American Southwest and everywhere else in the world who will struggle with water supplies in the near future should look to Las Vegas for their inspiration of a city well designed to cope with the challenges of 21st century climate change

201
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:43,809
in the middle of one of earth's least hospitable desert environments

202
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,129
For if life can be sustained for millions of people and tens of millions of visitors here

203
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:55,049
through decades of clever design and foresight, it can also be achieved elsewhere

204
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Now

205
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:12,480
a major reason that I was so excited to make a video covering this topic is because I knew that I could get all kinds of spectacular footage of Las Vegas and the Colorado River without actually having to go travel and visit them myself by simply visiting my stock footage provider

206
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,890
Instead, storedlocks without any exaggeration

207
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,890
Since the very 1st real life lore videos that I created more than six years ago

208
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,190
Now

209
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,609
story Blocks has always been the 1st place that I've always gone to find footage for all of my videos

210
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:37,730
They offer an unlimited subscription so that you can download and use as much as you need for an annual price that's lower than what many other providers charge for just a single clip

211
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,890
And beyond that, unlimited subscription, storyblocks also offers an entirely royalty free library

212
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,690
meaning that you can use anything from the library for any commercial or personal use

213
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,410
And Storeblocks offers far more than just footage and templates

214
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:56,130
They also provide music, images, sound effects and much more

215
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,849
If you're already a creator or you're wanting to become one

216
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,650
I can absolutely tell you, from my more than six years of experience now

217
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:08,730
is their customer that story blocks is an absolutely critical resource for you to have

218
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,849
I genuinely don't think I know of a single full time creator who doesn't already have a subscription

219
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:19,650
