1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
This is France

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,259
Now, I know what you're thinking

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,900
If you live in Spain, italy, switzerland, germany, belgium, the UK, or, god forbid

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,060
within France itself, then you already know that you're not very far away from France

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:15,500
And if you live somewhere like North America, asia, australia or South America

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:17,820
then you know that you live pretty far away from France

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,890
Except that that 2nd part isn't really true

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,809
because the France I showed you at the beginning isn't really the entirety of France

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,329
In reality, france is everywhere across the world, like literally everywhere

10
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:32,649
Here's France and North America

11
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,369
Here's France and South America and the Caribbean

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,810
including this island right here that's divided between France and the Netherlands

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,210
meaning that France and the Netherlands actually do share a border

14
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:42,729
It's just not in Europe

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,450
It's in the Caribbean

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,210
Here's France closer to Mexico

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,570
Here's France around Madagascar

18
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:48,530
Here's France in the Indian Ocean

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,570
and here's France in the Pacific Ocean

20
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:52,609
With all of these different locations across the globe

21
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:56,810
you're probably not as far away from France as you may have thought, if you don't live in Europe

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,490
Inspired by a map I found created by a Reddit user named all hale Madame

23
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,929
let's take a look at how far away you really are from France

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,090
Colored in black

25
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,209
Is France itself within any of the red zones Europe

26
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,890
unfortunately, less than 1000 km away from sovereign French territory

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,370
meaning that you could pretty much begin hearing French at nearly any minute

28
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,010
Areas like Nova Scotia, new Brunzwick, quebec, maine, venice, suela, brazil, madagascar

29
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,250
mozambique and South Africa are pretty much all just as far away from actual sovereign France as Germany or Austria

30
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,049
Within the orange zone, you're less than 2000 km away from France

31
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,969
which includes the entire northeastern United States, most of Mexico

32
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,450
with the entire Caribbean and a whole lot of Africa

33
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:43,109
These zones radiating out until we're left with this empty patch here

34
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:43,930
Across East Asia

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,890
Within this zone

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,890
you're pretty safe because you're more than 7000 km away from any French territory

37
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:55,290
and it's the furthest possible area away from France you can get anywhere on the planet

38
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,489
spanning across most of China, north hurry up, the Japanese island of Okado

39
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,329
and far eastern Russia

40
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,290
Now, the various parts of France that exist all over the world, outside of Europe

41
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,210
that make all of this possible, are known as Overseas France

42
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,930
And it's this other part of France that makes France a true global, 21st century great power

43
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,330
Altogether, these various islands and landmasses outside of Europe

44
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:26,650
at 119386 kmÂ² of territory to the French Republic

45
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,409
which is 18 % of france's total land area

46
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,169
and is roughly the same size as either North Korea or Bulgaria

47
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,129
It's huge

48
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,729
and nearly 3 million people live across it all

49
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,330
which is about how many people live in the US state of Kansas

50
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:45,590
And it represents about 4 % of the entire French population

51
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,969
Oh yeah

52
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,810
And that's the thing they're all citizens of France

53
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,449
and therefore citizens of the European Union by extension as well

54
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:57,210
which makes all nearly 3 million of them living in places as far away as the Caribbean

55
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,770
south America and the Pacific Ocean, all capable of voting in both French and European elections

56
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,169
And because of all these territories existing across the globe

57
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,449
france is actually the country with the highest number of time zones

58
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,610
Russia, the world's largest country, spans across only eleven time zones, from west to east

59
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,610
But France, with her empire across the world

60
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:28,169
actually spans across 13 time zones that are shared with places as far away as encourage Honolulu

61
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:31,770
los Angeles, new York City, rio de Janeiro, paris, obviously

62
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,050
moscow, dubai, karachi, vladiva, stock, sydney and Auckland

63
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,969
It appears that in the 21st century, the sun continues to never set on the French Empire

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,430
But that's all just kind of begs another question

65
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:52,729
Why in the world does France even have an empire but still this vast outside of Europe

66
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:55,050
Well, like every other European power

67
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,289
france also got in on the overseas empire game over hundreds of years of progress

68
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,810
with colonies across Africa, the Middle East in Asia

69
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:06,169
But after World War II, the world stopped being very sympathetic to colonies

70
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,289
and the colonies of France gradually began declaring their own independences

71
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,409
culminating with france's final colony in Africa, gibouti in 1977

72
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,569
and the Pacific island of Vanuatu in 1980

73
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:25,250
What remains are the final of vestiges of the ancient French colonial empire that simply never desired independence for themselves

74
00:04:25,769 --> 00:04:28,970
and have thus remained a part of 21st century France

75
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,629
Some of them are totally uninhabited

76
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,410
Are really only home to seasonal scientists like Clipperton Island here in the Pacific

77
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:43,730
the various islands of the Southern and Antarctic lands and Adeliland Francis claim over Antarctica that grants them direct access to the South Pole

78
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,529
But all the other places are actually inhabited by permanent populations of people

79
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,569
and some of them are really hugely important places

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,689
There's Reunion Island, way out here, over by Madagascar in the Indian Ocean

81
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,769
with a population of more than 850000 people

82
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,170
which alone is more than two actual EU member states, malta and Luxemberg

83
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,129
and nearly as much as a 3rd Cyprus, nearby

84
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,730
Mayote has an additional population of more than 270000

85
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,370
meaning that there's over a million French citizens living in the Indian Ocean

86
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,649
Were by Madagascar in Africa

87
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,560
Both islands are a fully fledged integral part of France

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,300
They use Euros

89
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:27,579
and as such, they're the outermost region of both the European Union and the Eurozone

90
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,699
like two distant moons orbiting around their faraway planet

91
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:38,740
Reunion is one of the few locations the Europeans discovered across the world that was actually truly Uninhabi back at the time

92
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,180
And the French acquired it back in the 17th century and have simply kept it ever since

93
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,379
But there's other big locations in Frances overseas territories too, like French Kiana

94
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,300
way over here in South America, just like Reunion

95
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,620
french Kayana is an intangural part of France that uses Euros and is part of the European Union

96
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,860
Despite bordering Brazil and containing part of the Amazon rainforest

97
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,060
this little chunk of Europe and France and South America isn't really so little, though

98
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,139
because it's nearly the same size as Austria and one 7th the size of metropolitan France itself

99
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,259
back in Europe, albeit with a pretty little population of only about 300000 people

100
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:24,060
which means that the population density throughout is on a par with that's because nearly 99 % of French Guiana is completely covered by forests

101
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,180
including the Guiana Amazonian Park

102
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,339
which alone takes up more than 40 % of French Guiana

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,860
and is, hilariously, the largest national park of the European Union

104
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,360
Despite, well, you know, being located in South America

105
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,180
French Guiana is immensely important to both France and Europe today

106
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,259
because it is the primary launch site for rockets of the European Space Agency, are ESA

107
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,600
And it's specifically because of French geographic location

108
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,540
Look at this map of the world

109
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,540
and then think to yourself

110
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,779
where are the best locations possible to blast rockets off in a space from

111
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,720
The correct answer is as close as you can get to the equator across the earth's center

112
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,740
And it's because here along this line, the planet is rotating faster than anywhere else

113
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,500
Rockets need all the speed they can get in order to break out of our gravity

114
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:15,339
and the earth's natural rotation speed can give them a much needed boost

115
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:20,620
Unfortunately for Europe, the equator runs pretty considerably far away from their continents

116
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,860
which makes blasting rockets off from there a little more challenging

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,480
But fortunately for Europe, they spent centuries taking over colonies in other parts of the world

118
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,060
And it turned out that French Guiana, in particular, is located really, really close to the equator

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,139
And so that's how this little chunk of South America became europe's most important spaceport

120
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,220
It's so important that at one point back in the 1990s

121
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:50,779
the Guiana Space Center alone accounted for more than a quarter of French guiana's entire GDP

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,939
All right, so moving on over to the Pacific

123
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,339
france retains possessions of hundreds of islands and talls across French Polynesia

124
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,579
in Caledonia, wallison, futuna and Clipperton Island

125
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,699
including the island of Bora, bora, inside a French Polynesia

126
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,939
which is one of france's most popular tourist destinations

127
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,220
despite being located on the complete opposite side of the world from Paris

128
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:22,779
But the pacific part of France carries a darker secret than the other parts of overseas France does because it was here that France primarily conducted their decades long nuclear weapons testing

129
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,660
Back in 1960, when the French Empire still spanned much more of the globe

130
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,100
france became the 4th country to successfully test in detonated nuclear weapon

131
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,019
after the United States, soviet Union and United Kingdom

132
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,340
but they did so initially within the empty deserts of Algeria, awkwardly

133
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,779
at the same time that Algeria was fighting a war against France for their own independence

134
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:50,580
France would go on to detonate a total of 17 nuclear weapons inside of the empty deserts of Algeria before it became an independent nation

135
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,019
after which, they subsequently refused to continue allowing France to test their nukes there

136
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,259
so still one in a test their bomb somewhere

137
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,779
They began looking for alternatives

138
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,419
One such idea was to begin testing them on the uninhabited Clipperton Island, nearby to Mexico

139
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,100
but this was ruled out because of the island's intense level of remoteness

140
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,620
and also Mexico probably would have had a thing or two to say about it

141
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,340
Eventually, france settled on continuing their nuclear weapons testing over in French Polynesia

142
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,379
where a total of 193 three detonations would be carried out in the Pacific Ocean nearby

143
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,980
which brought France directly into conflict with nearby New Zealand in 1985

144
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,019
Back then

145
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:34,980
the organization Greenpeace orchestrated a campaign against the continued French nuclear testing in the area with a boat called the Rainbow Warrior

146
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,419
which was docked in port inside of Auckland

147
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,299
New The ship was about to depart towards French Polynesia to protest against a planned French nuclear test

148
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,340
when two undercover French operatives secretly snug on board

149
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,220
planted a bomb and then blew the ship apart

150
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,340
The explosion sank the ship and killed a Green Piece photographer who was on board

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,299
The French agents were quickly apprehended afterwards by the New Zealand police

152
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,460
and were each sentenced to ten years in prison for manslaughter

153
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,139
They would ultimately only serve for two years before being freed by the French government

154
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,899
Many political figures, especially in New Zealand

155
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:18,340
have consistently referred to the action ever since as an incident of French states sponsored terrorism

156
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,860
And France would ultimately agree to pay million dollars in damages to Greenpeace

157
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,980
along with million dollars to the New Zealand government as an apology

158
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,379
and a further half a million dollars to the photographer's family as compensation

159
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,220
France would continue testing nuclear weapons in Polynesia for eleven more years

160
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,299
until in 1996, the year of their final detonation

161
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,460
and ever since

162
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,500
they've switched to using computer simulations for their nuclear weapons testing instead

163
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,580
And today

164
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:52,299
france maintains an arsenal of approximately 300 nuclear weapons

165
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,860
the 3rd largest arsenal in the world, after the United States and Russia

166
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,220
So that was one the reason that France kept much of their overseas empire

167
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,580
But overall

168
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:13,899
the biggest reason why France maintains the overseas empire up to the present is because of the control that it gives France and the European Union as a proxy over the world's oceans

169
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,580
You see, under the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or unclose

170
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,500
any country may claim an exclusive economic zone or EEG of the water surrounding their sovereign coastline

171
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,179
the country making the claim retains the sole and exclusive legal authority for all fishing

172
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,500
drilling, mining and all other economic activities

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,940
And because of there are hundreds of islands and territories that are scattered across all the corners of the Earth

174
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,019
France actually possesses the modern world's largest EEG

175
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,980
and therefore the largest maritime territory of any 20 st century nation

176
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:52,539
ahead of even the United States and Australia

177
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,899
France's EEG spans nearly 11.7 million kmÂ² of ocean, across the bay of this sky, the Indian Ocean

178
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,179
while almost completely surrounding Madagascar, huge blotches of the Pacific Ocean

179
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,220
and even a tiny little sliver here just south of Canada

180
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,820
These small islands are st Pierre and Megalone

181
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,659
And despite being located right next to Newfoundland and Canada

182
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,899
they're a part of France, then home to more than French citizens who all use years

183
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,279
They are the small, final remaining vestiges of the old colonial new France in the Americas

184
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,820
And they have a fascinating history of control

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,419
When France was defeated in the Seven Years War back in 1763

186
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,059
they were forced to seed all of their North American possessions over to the British

187
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,940
But since the British continued to grant the French fishing rights along the Newfoundland coast

188
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:41,539
they allowed them to keep the tiny islands as a little fishing outpost

189
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,379
When France supported America during the American Revolution, burton invaded the islands

190
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,860
raised the settlement and exiled the entire French population back to European France

191
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,220
Out of spite, burton tried to bring in British settlers to repopulate the islands

192
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,860
but then the French came back and sacked the British column

193
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,080
Eventually, the British gave the islands back to France once again in 1802

194
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,019
But then, after war with Napoleon interrupted, they reoccupied them again the very next year

195
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,700
in 1803, when the Napoleonic wars were concluded

196
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,740
Eleven years later

197
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,179
and 18 and 14, the British once again gave the islands back to France

198
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,860
but then occupied them again in 1815, when Napoleon briefly returned to power in France

199
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,539
and then gave them back to France yet again, after he was defeated after Waterloo, for good

200
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
And theyve been French ever since

201
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,620
During the 1st World War, all of the men on the islands were drafted

202
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,860
and about 400 went on to serve on the Western front in Europe, where a quarter of them would die

203
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,460
When the topic of eegs came up in the 1970s

204
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,539
france initially claimed a huge one for the tiny little islands that severely interrupted nearby canada's E-E-Z

205
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:48,100
which led to a very long legal dispute between both countries over fishing rights

206
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:55,820
It was only eventually settled in 1992 when France accepted the significantly smaller and narrower boundaries of the current EEG here

207
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,779
But it's still kind of weird

208
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,779
because now the French control this zone where they're the only ones who are allowed to fish

209
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,500
and it's completely surrounded by the zone where the Canadians are the only ones who are allowed to fish

210
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,700
So Canadian fishermen have to always move around it

211
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,620
and local French fishermen are always confined within it

212
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,940
But when zooming back out again to see the full picture, francis, the oceanic territory

213
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:25,299
all combined across the world, is larger than the entirety of the European continent itself

214
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,340
And France possesses 8 % of the entire world's e easy areas

215
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:40,740
despite the fact that France itself only possesses zero point 45 % of the world's land and only 84 % of the world's population

216
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,259
If you were to combine both land and maritime area for every country in the world, then France

217
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,980
all of a sudden ranks as the world's 5th largest country

218
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:54,100
beating up places like Brazil, china, india or Indonesia

219
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,620
which is, frankly, just ridiculous

220
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,059
And it all gives France and, by extension

221
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,700
the European Union an enormous global geopolitical advantage

222
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,659
When also factoring in spains, portugals, the Netherlands and denmarks overseas territories

223
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,940
the European union's collective E-E-Z enables it to dominate the entire baltic control

224
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:18,259
nearly the entire Mediterranean and the eastern north of Atlantic

225
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,299
and have outposts across every ocean and every corner of the globe

226
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,740
after the United Kingdom and the United States

227
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:32,299
France even further maintains the 3rd largest amount of overseas military bases outside of their home territory

228
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,820
with bases all across their overseas possessions in South America

229
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,940
the Caribbean, indian and Pacific Ocean

230
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,539
with even further bases across many of their former colonies in Africa

231
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,620
like Jibouti, ivory, coast, gabone, senegal, mali, chad, niger

232
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:50,340
Additional bases across the Middle East, in Syria, iraq, jordan and the UAE

233
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,179
and a final two more inside of Germany

234
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:53,879
Altogether

235
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:59,779
france maintains a force of more than 36000 soldiers deployed to these territories across the world

236
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:00,779
and ever since

237
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:08,259
the French have initiated military interventions across these nine countries on two separate continents

238
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,940
The presence of these French military bases and soldiers all across the world

239
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,539
from South America to Africa

240
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,860
the Middle East and the Pacific gives the French a very similar capability the United States

241
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:26,259
They can project power and deploy military assets at a moment's notice to counter almost any threat anywhere on the planet

242
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,100
So when you look at a map like this, you realize that the Global French

243
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:37,019
and therefore the global European empire, is very much still alive and well in the 21st century

244
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:43,019
and as as a result, france and Europe are probably a lot closer to you than you may have realized

245
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,019
But something else you may haven't realized yet is just how much you're probably over paying for your current cell phone plan

246
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,580
and how much you could save by switching over to Team

247
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,799
I personally switched over to Team myself a few months ago

248
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,179
And why

249
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,100
Well, because of this, yep

250
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,620
that's actual a real phone bill that I received for my old carrier right before I made my switch earlier this year

251
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,460
But Team Mobile has three different plans to choose from to make sure that never happens again

252
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,740
Unlimited talk in text starts at just $10

253
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,180
and then datas $5 a gigabyte

254
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
or you can just get their unlimited plan for just $45

255
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,700
They've also got other plans with five or twelve

256
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,539
It invites data

257
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:18,940
but regardless

258
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,339
the point is that you can get the same service you have right now with the same phone number you have right now

259
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,859
for much less money

260
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,420
So if you've ever got a bill like mine, your service probably won't change

261
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,920
It's pretty much a no brainer

262
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:36,900
But what should really seal the deal is that when you click the button that's on your screen right now or follow the link that's down in the description

263
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,380
you'll get totally free $25 credit, enough for an entire month of service on some of their plans

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,660
And signing up there really helps to support real life law at the same time

265
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:52,029
And as always, thank you so much for watching
