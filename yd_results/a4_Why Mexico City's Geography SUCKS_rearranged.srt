1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,340
This is Mexico City

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,740
It is currently the 6th largest city in the entire world

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,940
with nearly 3 million more people than New York

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,900
And it's by far the largest Spanish speaking city in the world

5
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,460
Mexico City is high on the list of the worlds most significant and influential cities

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,050
But it has one enormous and one very old The entire city is sinking into the ground at an insanely alarming rate

7
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,329
with some parts at about half a meter every single year

8
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:49,090
That is so fast that many geologists have predicted most of Mexico City will sink about meters beneath where it currently stands by the end of the st with some particularly heavy head areas sinking more than 30 m Imagine your house sinking 30 m beneath where it is today

9
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,890
That would be a hole so deep, if you stood at the top and jumped in

10
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:56,649
it'd take about two and a half seconds for you to hit the bottom

11
00:00:57,549 --> 00:00:59,049
Unfortunately for millions of Mexicans

12
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:04,890
this is exactly what's going to happen to them very slowly over the course of the next few decades

13
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,209
And it's all because humans are really

14
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:12,049
really prone to choosing objectively terrible locations to place their cities in

15
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:18,790
Mexico City, in particular, has some of the worst geography stats of any major city in the world

16
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,450
And this is why let's rewind the geographical and historical clock back a little over 700 years ago

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,450
Back then, the region's geography and reality was very different from today

18
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,969
The city didn't exist

19
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,810
and in its place was a large lake called Lake Texkoco

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,329
wedged in a large valley surrounded by high mountains and volcanoes on all sides

21
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,370
Legend has it that for a hundred years before this

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:51,209
the nomadic Mexico tribe awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy They would eventually settle down and build the greatest city in the world

23
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,010
where the location would be determined Wherever they saw an eagle eating a snake in its beak while perched a top a cactus

24
00:01:59,689 --> 00:01:59,689
Eventually

25
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:09,889
this prophecy would be realized when the Mexico finally saw this exact vision in the most unlikely of places for the greatest city the world would ever see

26
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,930
a small, unpopulated and swampy island right here in the middle of Lake Texkoco

27
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,250
But undeterred by the formidable terrain

28
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,370
the Mexico kept true to their prophecy and began building their great city

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,050
And over the next two centuries, this small

30
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,210
swampy island was continually enlarged by landfills and floating gardens

31
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,610
until it eventually evolved into Tanochitlan

32
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,409
the capital of the Aztec empire and one of the largest cities in the entire medieval world

33
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:44,849
By the time the Spanish arrived in 15 in 19 Tono Stetlan was five times the size of London under Henry the 8th

34
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,250
And at the time, considering the aztecs position on the tech tree

35
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,169
the city's geography didn't actually seem so bad

36
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:55,050
Without being fortunate enough to have any pack animals like horses or oxen

37
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,849
and without having discovered any practical use of the wheel

38
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,169
the aztecs had no other means available to them for transporting goods and conducting trade

39
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,289
Then, by moving across the water on boats to notes

40
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,409
delon's various canals easily facilitated this role

41
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,889
And when you combine that with a complex series of dams they built that provided abundant

42
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,289
clean drinking water, extremely rich in fertile soil

43
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,969
and a highly defensible position surrounded by a literal moat

44
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,090
It's no wonder that the city became Meso america's most successful

45
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,689
That is, until the Spanish and Cortes arrived In 1519, tanojdelan was put under a brutal siege

46
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,889
and under cortes' direct orders

47
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:45,650
the Aztec dams across the lake were destroyed in order to turn Lake Texoco salt and deny the astex inside of any access to clean drinking water without their drinking water

48
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:50,090
And after a virulent smallpox epidemic, the astex inside withered away

49
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,849
and the Spanish conquered and subsequently raised the city almost completely to the ground

50
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:57,330
brick by brick

51
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,460
By the end of the 16th century

52
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,020
the once great city of tonochitlan's population had declined by over 90 %

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,939
And atop the ruins, the Spaniards founded their new settlement, called Mexico City

54
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,780
and this is when the big problems really began

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,540
The Spaniards never rebut the Aztec dams and dikes and replace them with more familiar streets

56
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,540
public squares

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Instead

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,019
On the plus side

59
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:27,379
this allowed them to gradually reclaim more and more land from the lake to make more space for Mexico cities growing population and buildings

60
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:28,540
But on the other side

61
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,779
this meant that the city was expanding into a swamp that was surrounded by a lake without any dam to keep out any of the lakes Water flooding

62
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,420
Therefore it became a constant problem for Mexico City as it expanded and grew

63
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,620
including one particularly bad case in 1629, when the city flooded for five straight years

64
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,720
The Spanish crown even discussed moving the location of the city to a bit less geographically problematic place

65
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:03,129
But evidently they thought they just decided to stay and drain the lake even more and even more instead under the aztecs

66
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,209
To notes to lan's population was around 400000 at its peak

67
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,490
and was basically just a small but very dense dot within Lake tex Cocoa

68
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,029
By 19 hundred, the population here was actually pretty much the same

69
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,329
But the 20th century would see the city's population absolutely skyrocket

70
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,930
By 1950, the city had grown to cover 30 sq mi

71
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:29,029
And was home to over 3 million people

72
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:36,730
And today, mexico City has grown from there to cover an area of approximately 3000 sq mi

73
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,449
And with nearly 22 million people

74
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:55,050
This enormous development in just a hundred years has effectively wiped out any trace of the former waters of Lake Texkoco and covered it instead with a lake of concrete and its wreaked total havoc on the valleys environment Mexico cities

75
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:00,129
in a region that receives even more rain fall in infamously rainy places like London or Seattle

76
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,009
But despite that, the city perpetually struggles to provide enough water for her citizens

77
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:07,810
Without the waters of Latex Cocoa

78
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:15,279
the city has been forced to drill deeper and deeper into the below ground aquifers in her ever desperate quest for water

79
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,519
The problem here is that the land beneath Mexico City is an ancient, soft clay lakebed

80
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,680
At as Mexico City drills for more and more water

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the clay weakens and crumbles the water pressure within the aquifer's support the soil above it

82
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,519
which in turn supports the city above it

83
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,360
However, as the water is drained and removed, the soil above compacts

84
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,120
This complexion, combined with the lower water pressure pushing from beneath

85
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,000
will slowly cause the city to sink over time

86
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,319
and rainwater can't easily get into the aquifers to replenish them

87
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,600
because the land and above is now absolutely covered in the concrete

88
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,720
sprawling chaos of the world's 6th largest city

89
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,649
And as a result, mexico City is trapped in a vicious geologic cycle

90
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,389
As the population grows, the demand for water further increases

91
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,069
But without the waters of the natural lake

92
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,269
she has then left with no other choice but to drill deeper into the below ground aquifers

93
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:18,910
which reduces the soil stability above and leads to the city sinking even further and further with the increased development above from the increasing population

94
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,470
rainwater can't get in to replenish the aquifers

95
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,310
and the soil's instability continues to get worse

96
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:28,430
Climate change even further exacerbates these already dire conditions

97
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,990
since more heat and more drought in the region inevitably also means more evaporation and even more demand for the already scarce water supply

98
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,269
leading to even further drilling and, of course, even further sinking

99
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,069
Mexico City, of course, knows all of this

100
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,629
and through a complex series of canals and pipes

101
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,750
they now import about 40 % of their water supply from other regions of Mexico

102
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,230
However, these canals and pipes are wildly inefficient

103
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,790
Constantly shifting elevation causes pipes below the ground to routinely crack and burst

104
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,069
while the struggling city government is rarely capable of mounting any kind of significant repairs

105
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,509
And as a result of that, for every one gallon of water that is pumped into the pipes of Mexico City

106
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,269
more than one 3rd of it will simply be lost

107
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:21,990
And the energy that require to pump all of that water up to a city that's a mile and a half high in elevation in the mountains

108
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,709
is more than what the entire city of Kuuebla consumes

109
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:29,189
a city with roughly the same population as Philadelphia

110
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,189
So as a result

111
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:39,789
mexico City faces water shortages as if it were in the middle of a despite receiving more rainfall than London

112
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,509
And there isn't any easy or obvious solution for them to get out of this

113
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,789
But the city's singing problem affects far more than just the water supply

114
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,429
since it affects some areas worse than others, roads will suddenly buckle and wobble

115
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,950
Buildings tip over and look like they're about to collapse

116
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:58,350
The metro system in some areas will resemble more of a roller coaster

117
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,990
while the destruction caused by earthquakes is greatly amplified

118
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,149
Mexico City is unfortunately located within a seismically active zone

119
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:10,669
and with most of the city's core located on the weak and Sulty Clay Lake bed

120
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,110
the soil will often behave more like a liquid during an earthquake

121
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,789
causing the buildings above to be even more greatly damaged than they otherwise would be

122
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,909
This is how in the Mexico City

123
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:26,230
earthquake caused such catastrophic damage and loss in life to the city

124
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:34,990
Mexico city's rapid and unexpected population explosion in the 20th century caused other unnatural problems to crop up as well

125
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:42,830
By two Mexico City was home to more than 50000 industries and more than 4 million motor vehicles

126
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,509
Due to the city's high elevation, a mile and a half above sea level

127
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:52,429
its oxygen levels are 25 % lower when compared to a city that is precisely at sea level

128
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,389
and therefore fuels don't combust as efficiently

129
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:00,549
For further Mexico City is located within a high valley that's surrounded by tall mountains

130
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,629
which effectively keeps pollutants and exhaust trapped within without any place to go

131
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,230
This all meant that by 1992, the UN had labeled Mexico City as the world's most polluted city

132
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,870
But 30 years later, after a variety of methods

133
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:20,649
mexico City has managed to get their air pollution levels down in the valley to about the same level scene in Los Angeles today

134
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:28,389
But air pollution continues to be the 8th leading cause of death within Mexico and causes about one in every 17 deaths in the country

135
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,879
For the Aztec seven centuries ago, settling on an island in Lake Texkoco

136
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,000
not only fulfilled an ancient prophecy

137
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,480
but made perfect geographic sense with their understanding of technology and limited population at the time

138
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,720
In the current day, though

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,919
it's one of the worst locations imaginable for the industrialized world's 6th largest city

140
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,799
and has caused countless problems for centuries

141
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,639
But it's too late now, since pushing Mexico City somewhere else just isn't really feasible

142
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,360
Mexico city's countless geographic problems are just effect of life now

143
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,440
and something that has to be lived with, because in the end, nature will always win

144
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:12,799
Mexico City struggle against her environment has been one of the most massive and intimidating projects that humanity has had to have

145
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,759
ever undertaken

146
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,480
Maybe you're watching this and you've got your own project or personal goal that you've been meaning to start recently that you thank you

147
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,519
Similarly challenging

148
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,519
and as a result, you're unsure that you have the skills required to go about doing it

149
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,000
Just yet

150
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,759
Whatever it is you're wanting to do

151
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
whether it's getting started, creating your own youtube channel

152
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,759
making videos like this one or any other big project

153
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,720
the best place to get started is over on skill Share

154
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,419
Five years ago, I was in the exact same position as you

155
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,600
The project that I wanted to start was my youtube channel

156
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,120
but I had absolutely zero idea what I was doing or how to even get started

157
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,360
I never went to school for or art

158
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,799
and I doubt in my abilities to ever create anything than anyone would actually want to watch

159
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:00,360
In the end, I had to teach myself over the years by watching tutorial videos online here on youtube

160
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,940
But eventually I got introduced to skill Share

161
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:08,379
and through targeted classes like this one called Make Animated Youtube Videos by Evan from Polly Matter

162
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,220
whose since become my friend, I accelerated my learning even further

163
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,100
The classes on skill Share are from real professionals who have tons of experience in what they're talking about

164
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,860

165
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,820

the perfect place to begin with would be the class Youtube Success Script shoot and edit with MKBHD
