1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,299
in 2001, the united states military invaded afghanistan

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:12,539
20 years later, the u-s is withdrawing, and the taliban appears to be stronger than ever, with control of up to 85 % of the country

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:24,370
in 1979, the soviet union also invaded afghanistan, and after nine years, they also withdrew the regime they fought so hard to prop up, almost immediately collapsed

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:32,969
and before them, the british empire invaded afghanistan on three separate occasions and failed to conquer them in each instance

5
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:39,590
today, afghanistan has a smaller population than california, in a territory that's only a little larger than france

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:48,520
so how is it that a country of this small size was capable of resisting three of the world's most powerful military juggernauts from history

7
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:55,939
there's a lot of answers to that question, but let's start with the easiest to understand, and perhaps the most obvious geography

8
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,729
in reality, afghanistan is little more than a geographical expression

9
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,849
all of her borders were arbitrarily drawn up by outside foreign powers more than a century ago

10
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:23,950
its small population is composed of a loose association of 14 different ethno linguistic groups and numerous more tribes, many of which, like the uzbeks to g greeks and pashtons, straddle the country's borders, artificial boundaries set up by westerners hundreds of years ago that mean very little to them

11
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:33,489
the peshtons make up nearly half of afghanistan's population a day, but two thirds of all pashtons live next door in neighboring pakistan, and are a minority group there

12
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:42,049
the border between afghanistan and pakistan runs directly through the pashton tribal area and divides the 60 million pashton people between both countries

13
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:52,230
this boundary was artificially dissent by the british empire back in 1893, and to date, not a single government based in afghanistan has ever officially ratified it

14
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,510
imagine if in europe, poland was divided between germany and russia, and a wall was built directly between both sides of where the poles live

15
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,150
obviously, the poles would never recognize this border and routinely cross it visit family and friends

16
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,930
and the pastones largely treat the afghan pakistan border the very same way

17
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,830
the border here is extremely mountainous and rural, so patrolling it from the pakistani government's perspective has always been quite challenging

18
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:34,729
this has allowed pastun insurgents operating with an afghanistan the valuable ability to easily escape across the border into the friendly pastun areas of pakistan, regroup and recover, recruit more men and then travel back into afghanistan, freshly supplied and ready for more combat

19
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:45,710
neither the afghan border nor the taliban recognize this border as legitimate, and there are at least 235 known crossing points across the border and through the mountains between both countries

20
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,669
militants, drugs, money and supplies can easily be smuggled into afghanistan by way of pakistan

21
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:58,509
and it's made all the easier by many of the pastones of pakistan being more sympathetic to the afghan or taliban cause

22
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:05,389
this has led many people to label the afghan pakistan border as the most dangerous border in the entire world

23
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:20,740
and recently, as a result of all of this, by the end of june, pakistan has finally finished building a fence across the entire length of the border, specifically to stop all of this, and has restricted border crossings to only legally designated locations

24
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:27,539
but this is all only the start of what makes afghanistan an almost most impossible place to conquer

25
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,740
i mean, just look at the map

26
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:43,379
afghanistan is a landlocked so getting your troops and supplies there requires the cooperation of at least one of the six countries that borders it, iran, turkmenistan, uzbekistan, tajikistan, china and of course, pakistan

27
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:52,460
but even once you get across one of the countries and you arrive at afghanistan's borders, you're going to be met with afghanistan's mon you mentally challenging terrain

28
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:01,229
despite being in the center of the world's most populous continent, afghanistan has always been heavily isolated and largely rural and underpopulated

29
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:10,229
because of this, the high peaks of the hindu kush mountain range was some of the tallest and biggest mountains found anywhere on the planet

30
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:25,009
75 % of afghanistan territories consider to be mountainous, and nearly half of our territory has an elevation above 2000 m, which makes afghanistan among the most mountainous countries of the world, and among the most isolated too

31
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,629
as a result, these huge mountains act like natural walls in more ways than one

32
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:38,290
they help to keep invaders out, but they also separate communities within and make transporting supplies across challenging

33
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,750
these are all very difficult factors to overcome from the perspective of any outside invader

34
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:56,709
there are dozens of valleys that zigzag in between the mountains of afghanistan, where most of the population resides, and since they're surrounded by some of the biggest and most formidable mountains on earth, it's always been difficult to travel between them

35
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,529
and consequently, they're each sort of their own little world in sight of afghanistan

36
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:13,389
over thousands of years, each ended up developing their own rather distinctive cultures, identities, beliefs, tribes and rulers, and thus there's very little sense of afghan nationhood

37
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:22,470
and afghan patriotism has never been a particularly strong motivating factor because of all these separate and rural communities that are difficult to travel between

38
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,589
the grip of any government has always been weak and intermittent, while the valleys have

39
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,810
largely governed themselves autonomously, especially in the countryside

40
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:41,730
any semblance of afghan national unity has always been a direct consequence of foreign powers invading and attempting to impose their rule over the whole

41
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:47,129
like with the british soviets in recently, americans, historically, end up to the present day

42
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:55,589
to an extent, afghanistan continues to operate in a way that's more similar to the holy roman empire than the european union

43
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:10,069
the ruler in the capital city, kabul may nominally wheel desure authority over the entire realm, like the holy roman emperor, but is not able to wheel defecto authority over all of the various princes, valleys, tribes and clans

44
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:18,569
just like the holy roman, any invader coming into occupy afghanistan will struggle with all of the same issues that a domestic ruler

45
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:26,009
well, afghanistans geography is not very conducive to a centralized authority, and neither is afghanistan's infrastructure

46
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:40,899
enforcing your authority across the various afghan valleys means that you must move your troops and supplies from one to another through the various mountain passes that are often narrow and incredibly easy positions to set up an ambush in as a defender

47
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,220
these passes basically act like natural choke points for the movement of people all across afghanistan

48
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,180
and up until the 1960s, there were hardly even any roads to speak of that went through them

49
00:06:52,339 --> 00:07:05,560
control over just a few of these mountain passes can ensure control over an entire valley, and sabotaging one can block the flow of supplies and troops for days, weeks or even longer, depending upon the severity of the damage

50
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:15,699
soviets invaded the country, the mujahadin defenders would ambush soviet convoys as they traveled through these passes, and then immediately flee back and vanish into the caves of the mountains

51
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:26,279
when they were fired back upon, they would set up road blocks at river crossings or in other passes, and in some instances, were successful enough to block entire roads for months or even years

52
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:42,439
the town of coast, near the pakistan border was permanently sealed off from the rest of the country for the entire war by the muj adine, sabotaging a series of strategic roads, and the government forces blocked inside could only be supplied by air

53
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:55,220
and when the americans invaded, these passes were just as vital, so significant for them was the cyber pass here, the easiest and most direct path through the hindu cush between the indian subcontinent and central asia

54
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:07,000
this path has been used for thousands of years by conquerors, traders and missionaries all alike, and is without a doubt one of the most strategic locations to hold on the entire planet

55
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:14,100
at one point, nearly 80 % of all nato and u-s supplies that were being brought into afghanistan by road

56
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:26,439
we're all coming through the cyber pass via pakistan, which is kind of ironic, because most of the taliban s equipment were also coming from across the border in pakistan, just at different and more rural crossing point

57
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:34,179
the taliban knew how critically important the kyber pass was to the american war effort, so it was a frequent target of sabotage efforts

58
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:46,120
in 2009, the taliban blew up a bridge here, the temporarily shut down the entire pass, and america was forced to broaden their supply lines into afghanistan through the three central asian bordering countries as well

59
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:53,889
in the years before all of this war, the afghan government had attempted a build of circular highway that would connect all of their major economic centers together

60
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:59,250
but over the decades of civil war and soviet intervention, the highway was in very bad shape

61
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:08,450
by the time the united states invaded in 2001, there were only a mere 50 km of paved roads to speak of in the entire country

62
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:18,629
that's bigger than france. for comparison, france has million kilometers of paved roads in a smaller and significantly less mountainous territory

63
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:35,590
the lack of good roads only made the disparate valleys and communities of the afghan interior even more isolated from each other, and may transporting troops and supplies a logistical nightmare for the americans and the soviets before them, none of which helped at all for the countrys stability

64
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:47,750
as with all things in afghanistan, the development of new roads is difficult and expensive because of the harsh, mountainous terrain, the cold winter weather that often choose roads up and sabotage from the taliban and other insurgents

65
00:09:47,970 --> 00:10:02,049
building a repairing roads in the country necessitates hiring security and necessitates building them across harsh geography and climates, which means that it can get incredibly expensive, as much as $5 million per mile in some locations

66
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:11,970
and this is all in a country where the average person only makes a little over over $500 a year, one of the poorest and least developed nations on the planet

67
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:20,629
the construction of a single mile of road within afghanistan is about the combined annual wages of 90 800 afghanis

68
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:26,070
so obviously the funding for all of these projects has to come from abroad

69
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:33,149
ultimately, afghanistan is easy to invade and take over, but it's almost impossible to effectively hold it for long

70
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,720
the landscape is huge, with a lot of rural and empty places for insurgents and rebels to hide

71
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,159
getting troops in and establishing supply lines through massive mountains and narrow passes is challenging

72
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,340
an easy for guerrilla combatants to harass and disrupt

73
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:57,559
the relationship with neighboring pakistan is complex, and peshton insurgents can easily cross the border, regroup without much fear, and then return to fight in afghanistan whenever ready

74
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:12,100
the flow of insurgent supplies, money and manpower across the border is difficult to stop through the hundreds of high and remote mountain passes, and requires the cooperation of pakistan, which she is sometimes willing to give, and other times not

75
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,210
centralized rule is almost impossible to enforce outside of kabul, by way of afghanistan's geographic reality

76
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:33,909
and a nation building is inherently impossible, because even the concept of an afghan nation, among afghanistan's various ethnicities and tribes, is tenuous at best, and certainly radically different from the western idea of nation state such as germany or france

77
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:42,750
the colonial era borders of afghanistan, dictated by the british over a century ago, are probably the biggest core reason for afghanistan's instability

78
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:48,970
but afghanistan has been particularly unstable, even by former british colonial medaling standards

79
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:58,570
for the past 43 years, afghanistan, pakistan, has been embroiled in constant warfare, and it's an incredibly complex story to tell

80
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:14,730
from a communist revolution that enforced state atheism in one of the most conservative and religious countries on the planet to an invasion and occupation by the soviet union, three subsequent civil wars, and then the invasion of the american africans and nato and the united states occupation

81
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:19,490
that's all set to finally end after nearly 20 years, in about a month from now

82
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:32,149
it is one of the most fascinating, violent and controversial conflicts of both the 20th and 21st centuries, and unfortunately not acceptable for me to cover on youtube due to their terms of service

83
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:43,320
i know how making videos on youtube works, and i know that this video already has a super high chance of being demonitized and unpromoted by youtube's algorithm because of what i'm discussing

84
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:52,700
but the moment that i really start diving into the whole history of the afghan conflicts, why they began, how they were fought, and how it all led to where we are today

85
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,240
it's a guarantee that this video will be censored, and you won't get to see it

86
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:25,379
so instead, i created another full length companion video to this one with all of that controversial but fascinating information included, and uploaded that version to nebula, which, as you've probably heard by now, is home to tons of exclusive, ad free content, like my entire modern conflict series, with additional full length videos you can go watch right now, detailing the israel palestine conflicts, the 2020 armenia azerbaijan war, and the ongoing russo ukraine war in the don bass

87
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:35,299
of course, the reason why all of these videos are only on nebula is because the youtube algorithm actually punishes me and all other creators forever trying anything new

88
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,840
but nebula is a different platform without an algorithm and without ads

89
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:46,480
it's just a platform about great and unique content made by great and independent educational creators

90
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:53,019
nebula's ecosystem enables us to take big risks with expensive projects like america's big ghost town

91
00:13:53,179 --> 00:14:16,700
my own 35 minute long documentary shot on location around the sultan sea, the largest lake in california, and arguably america's greatest environmental disaster, that drove thousands from their homes, and as a result, created america's largest ghost town, and plenty of other projects for more creators you probably know, like whenover productions half as interesting, tom scott and many others

92
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,759
the best way to get access to nebula and all of this incredible content is definitely through the amazing curiosity stream

93
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:30,440
nebula bundle deal. with its current sales price, it's less than $15 a year to get access to both sites

94
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:47,039
and curiositys stream has some phenomenal stuff too, like afghanistan 1979, a 57 minute long, fantastic documentary that dives deep into the entire course of the soviet invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent war in amazing detail

95
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,480
if you felt like my video didn't go into and this is the video for you

96
00:14:51,639 --> 00:15:02,740
and it includes actual interviews with surviving veterans of the war from both the afghan and soviet perspectives alike, including mikhail gorbachev, with enormous amounts of historical footage and context

97
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:10,080
i really can't recommend this documentary enough, and i genuinely don't know about a better deal to exist in streaming

98
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:18,580
you get to streaming sites, both with content you'll actually watch and all for less than $15 a year at the current sales price

99
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:25,519
but what's more, signing up will actually help countless independent educational creators beyond just real life lower
