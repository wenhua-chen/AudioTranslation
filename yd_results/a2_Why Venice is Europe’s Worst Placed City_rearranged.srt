1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Venice is one of the world's most well known and visited cities

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:06,379
with over five and a half million tourists who visited and stayed the night

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:11,759
In 2019, venice received 21 times as many tourists as our native population

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:18,059
And despite only being home to about 260000 people, about the same number as live in Lubbock, texas

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,129
venice has visited more more often than cities that are significantly larger

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,809
like Moscow, madrid, munich, johannesburg or Toronto

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,370
To put it into another perspective, during 2019, the city of Venice

8
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,969
with a population that's not even 260000 people

9
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:40,890
received 86 % of the same number of overnight tourists as the entire country country of Brazil did

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,890
with a population of over 212000000 people

11
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:51,530
There's just something magical about this small city that's captured the imagination of generations across centuries

12
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,450
Perhaps it's the fact that even now in the 21st century

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,250
it's remained the final large urban environment in Europe that is survived without cars, trucks

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,969
and as continued to rely instead upon simple walking in boats, as they have for thousands of years

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:15,530
Or perhaps it's the sheer and ancient beauty of the canals and buildings themselves in the city that many consider to be a living museum

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,969
full of masterpieces from a bygone era that still speak to our souls today

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,810
But unfortunately, both are Venice and the world

18
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:32,510
Venice has two massive problems The entire city is drowning and too many people are coming to watch it die

19
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,390
These are all video clips that have been taken just in the past few years of a city at war with water

20
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,469
And the water has been getting stronger and stronger

21
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,409
Recently, venice has been getting flooded more than 60 times a year

22
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:48,870
And during the the worst of these floods

23
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,950
as much as 80 % of the entire city could find itself a little bit underwater

24
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,530
And then there's the number of people coming to see it before the pandemic shut the world down in 2020

25
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,349
2019 was the peak year for tourism in Venice

26
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,270
While five and a half million tourists visited and actually spent one night within the city

27
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,069
That year, 19 million more tourists visited and spent less than a day there

28
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,250
And Venice itself is really tiny

29
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:24,210
It's only about 5 kmÂ², an area with nearly 26 million people visiting in a single year

30
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,389
That means that at any given time in 2019

31
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,310
there was nearly one tourist for every three residents in the city

32
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,389
These problems have been getting worse and worse every year now for decades spots

33
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,909
In order to fully understand why this is happening now

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,469
and what's being done to save the city, you've got to understand some of the city's history

35
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:46,469
1st of all

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,030
the strategic location of Venice on an island in the center of a lagoon has long offered its security and protection from outside powers

37
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:01,069
Before the 5th century ad the lagoon itself was a relatively isolated and swampy backwater of the Roman empire

38
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:05,389
But when the Huns and Germanic peoples began their invasions of the Italian Peninsula

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,270
it generated one of the ancient world's greatest refugee crises

40
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:15,270
And many of these refugees sought the precious safety that was offered inside of the Venetian Lagoon

41
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,830
The lagoon is the largest wetland or marshy environment found anywhere around the Mediterranean Sea

42
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:31,229
and the dozens of island scattered across it that rise above the shallow water offered immensely valuable protection across the water from the marauding bands of Germans and huns back over on the mainland

43
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:32,270
And over time

44
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:39,750
the lagoon itself would become the well protected cradle for one of the most powerful and influential civilizations in history

45
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:49,030
For out of these islands gradually evolved the absurdly rich Venetian Republic and her massive maritime commercial empire

46
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:55,090
The lagoon itself offers multiple advantages for the home base of a maritime based civilization

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,069
The waters around the city provide a natural moat that any would be invaders have to successfully cross

48
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,349
1st Further

49
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:10,430
the waters around the city inside of the lagoon are generally calm because it's a shallow bay that's almost entirely enclosed from the rest of the Mediterranean Sea

50
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,310
with only these three possible entrances from the outside

51
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,350
meaning that the lagoon is a fantastic natural harbor for parking ships

52
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,199
In the position of venice inside of the safety of the lagoon

53
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:30,680
and the position of the lagoon at the very tippy top of the Adriatic Sea enabled the city an incredibly safe base of operations from which to build ships in peace

54
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,160
and from which to launch them out in war

55
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,389
This geographic advantage enabled the city of Venice, over time

56
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:44,430
to dominate the entire Adriatic and from there, over time, the entire Mediterranean Sea as well

57
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,910
Eventually, by the 14th century, the city had constructed the Venetian Arsenal

58
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,269
a massive shipyard that, at its height

59
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:59,790
took up 15 % of the entire city and was the largest industrial complex found anywhere in Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution

60
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,709
by almost independently inventing the assembly line

61
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,629
Nearly 600 years before Henry Ford

62
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:12,990
the Venetians were capable of producing fully equipped merchant or naval vessels at a rate of one every day

63
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:20,629
something that was completely unprecedented anywhere else in the world in the Medieval and Renaissance eras through this process

64
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,350
granted by their geographic advantages

65
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,110
the Venetians eventually assembled a fleet of more than 3000 ships

66
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,149
which they, at 1st used to completely safeguard their city

67
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,629
surrounded by a moat separated from the mainland

68
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:37,430
and then to dominate the entire Adriatic and Mediterranean seas

69
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:40,269
carving out colonies across the Asiatic coast

70
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,430
along with a sizable chunk of Greece and Cyprus

71
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,470
By dominating the Mediterranean

72
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,269
the Venetians completely monopolized the flow of trade coming into Europe from the east

73
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,589
And with their interesting location just south of the strategic Brenner pass through the Alps

74
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:01,230
they could easily funnel their goods both across Italy and north through the mountains to Germany and beyond

75
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:02,389
to the rest of Europe

76
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:09,069
Venice's geography all but guaranteed that it would become medieval europe's principal center of commerce and trade

77
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,329
And it quickly became the wealthiest city on the entire continent

78
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,930
But it a series of increasingly unfortunate events completely changed the entire calculus of power

79
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,750
1st of all, the Venetians, all on their own

80
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,430
decided to confront the significantly more powerful and rising Ottoman Empire

81
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,589
and lost against them, repeatedly

82
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,149
gradually losing more and more of their colonial possessions across the Mediterranean in the process

83
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:41,949
2nd venice's strategic location that enabled it to dominate trade from the East was only as good as the knowledge of the world map

84
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,230
and as the Portuguese began exploring more and more of it in the 16th century

85
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,709
they were able to completely undermine venice's prior advantage

86
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,790
Venice had spent centuries concentrating on building galleys that were light upon oars

87
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,629
the perfect ships for moving across the calm waters of an inland sea like the Mediterranean

88
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,629
but pretty terrible for moving across the unpredictable and often harsh waters of the open ocean

89
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:14,110
Venice was unable to adapt and therefore became locked inside of the Mediterranean and missed out on the European rush for colonies across other continents

90
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:18,389
And when the Portuguese discovered the cape of good hope for the Europeans, there

91
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,430
larger and more ocean worthy ships ended up dominating the Indian ocean itself

92
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,829
And the trade from the East shifted towards Portugal and other powers from there forever

93
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,069
destroying venice's prior monopoly and the source of her vast wealth

94
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:39,709
Venice's influence waned and waned across the following centuries until Venice itself was conquered by the French

95
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:49,750
and then passed back and forth between them and the Austrians for a while before finally becoming a part of the modern nation state of Italy itself for more than five centuries

96
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:50,129
Now

97
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:56,069
since Vasco Togama discovered the cape of good hope and opened up the in the ocean directly to European trade

98
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,870
venice has never again managed to regain its prior historical significance

99
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,949
And now today, in the 21st century

100
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,269
the city is facing these new modern crises that threaten its entire existence once again

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,019
Let's begin with a flooding issue

102
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Obviously

103
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,139
a city thats literally surrounded by water like Venice will have a flooding problem from time to time

104
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,379
much like New Orleans in the United States

105
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,800
But Venice is located in a uniquely flooded, vulnerable area

106
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,560
It's located in the lagoon at the very top of the Adriatic Sea

107
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,899
While the Adriatics long narrow, when rectangular shape amplifies the natural tides moving up it

108
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:41,019
meaning that the Adriatic naturally has substantially more extreme tidal events than the rest of the Mediterranean does

109
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,659
and the Adriatics pretty much funnels them all up right towards Venice

110
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,299
Further, the strong northbound winds in the area

111
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,179
whipping off the Adriatic blow directly only towards the three connections between the lagoon and the sea

112
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,500
which can significantly slow down or even totally block

113
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,980
the water outflow from the lagoon into the sea

114
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,700
And when that happens, the eb of water is blocked inside of the lagoon

115
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,299
And the next high tide that comes in overlaps with the previous one

116
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,500
which just kind of perpetuates this vicious, self supporting site

117
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,500
Make matters even worse

118
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,980
Venice is located at top the Adriatic tectonic plates

119
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,580
which is currently in the process of shifting beneath the Italian coast

120
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:26,100
meaning that Venice is naturally sinking and losing elevation in an area that's already highly prone to flooding

121
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,659
But in addition to these natural problems, humans have of course

122
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,779
been making even more man made problems for themselves as well

123
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,779
Had the Venetian Lagoon simply been left to itself into nature over the past thousand years

124
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:45,419
it probably would have completely filled up with silk by now because of the various major sediment rich rivers that used to flow into it

125
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,620
and Venice would have been more or less loosely connected to the mainland

126
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,460
The medieval Venetians well aware of this problem

127
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,139
and unwilling to allow venice's greatest offensive asset to be destroyed like this

128
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:02,299
they began diverting the rivers away from the lagoon to keep the sediment out and to keep Venice enclosed by water

129
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:02,980
Over time

130
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,899
this made the waters inside of the lagoon deeper and deeper and increase the scale of venice's moat and and therefore increase their safety from the mainland

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,179
But it also made flooding of the city itself worse as well, because, well

132
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,860
you know, there was just a higher volume of water around it

133
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,539
And then in the 19th century

134
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,779
the Italians built a railroad bridge the connected Venice over to the mainland

135
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:28,179
and this was even further expanded in the 1930s by the construction of a road bridge alongside of it

136
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:33,299
all of which significantly modified by the natural motion of the water inside of the lagoon

137
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,100
And in the 20th century

138
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,179
the Italian government created an industrial district immediately behind Venice

139
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,659
and it made the flooding problems even worse

140
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,299
Previously, to the industrial districts construction

141
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:51,100
the area was covered by several small islands just above sea level that acted pretty much like natural sponges whenever high time fights came in

142
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,659
But the government completely destroyed them by filling the entire area in to cover it all up for industry

143
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,460
And to make matters more worse, a navigable channel was dug across the lagoon that allowed large

144
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,899
modern oil tankers to reach the new industrial district

145
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,779
This artificial channel directly connected the lagoon with the sea

146
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,820
which obviously exist at the time of venice's foundation, thousands of years ago

147
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,539
and it's just become another entry point for high tides and storm surges coming into the lagoon from the Adriatic

148
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:26,299
Modern studies have indicated that Venice is still sinking at a rate of about one to 2 mm per year

149
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,740
And over the past decade

150
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:32,500
global sea levels were rising at a rate of about three millimeters per year

151
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:39,100
meaning that venice's actual sea level rise is above the global average because of their sinking problem

152
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,220
Back when modern flooding records of Venice began in 1872

153
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:46,940
there was only one severe flooding event before 1950 in the city

154
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,580
where the water reached a height of meters above sea level

155
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,100
From 1950 until today, however

156
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:55,100
which is nearly an equivalent amount of time

157
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:59,259
there have been 21 of the severe flooding events recorded

158
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,500
with more and more happening every new decade

159
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,059
Of the top ten highest floods measured in Venice since records began

160
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,139
four of them took place in 2019

161
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:10,379
and the biggest of them, in November

162
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,259
was so large it covered more than 80 % of the city and damaged multiple cultural heritage sites

163
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,039
In fact, the centerpiece of Venice St

164
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:24,580
Mark Square now regularly floods more than 60 times a year

165
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,019
which, way back in only happened four times

166
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,620
So now, in the 20 st century

167
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:40,220
venice's ambitious plan to fight back against the ocean and geography is called the Mondeosperimentalle or Most System

168
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:41,159
Essentially

169
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:48,620
this is a huge system that's designed to hold back the rising tides of the Adriatic during high tide in order to better protect the city

170
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
And after multiple delays, it's finally nearly finished

171
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,100
The system consists of several rows of large gates located at each of the three natural inlets

172
00:12:58,419 --> 00:12:59,779
the lead into the Venetian Lagoon

173
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,139
with the majority of the gates located at the Lito inlet, closest to the city of Venice itself

174
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,299
There are 78 of these gates in total across all three of the inlets

175
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,899
that are each around 20 meters wide, end up to 30 m in length

176
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,299
For the deepest sections

177
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,220
Under normal tidal conditions

178
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,659
the gates will remain full of water and rest within their respective housing structures down on the sea floor

179
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,980
But whenever a high tide coming in from the Adriadic is forecasted and the lagoon needs to be defended

180
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:35,500
the gates will rapidly be drained of water and filled up with comprine so they shoot back up to the surface and then stop the tide from surging into the lagoon

181
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,860
And then, once the high tide is over with

182
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:45,860
the gates will once again be filled up with water and return back down to the sea floor below and allow boats and the natural flow of water above to move about

183
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:53,539
The ultimate goal here is to leave the gates open as much as possible and allow in the natural rhythm between the lagoon and the sea to continue

184
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,740
and to only raise them up when absolutely necessary

185
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,820
But the system has not come without controversy

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,940
For one thing, the schedule and cost have been severely overblown when it was initially proposed

187
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,500
Most was supposed to be a ten year project and cost billion Europe

188
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:12,980
Construction began way back in 2003

189
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:19,500
and it's expected to finally finish only now, at the end of this year, in 2021

190
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,740
more than eight years behind schedule and more than billion euros over budget

191
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,700
Back in 2014, 35 people, including then Mayor of Venice

192
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:37,299
were all arrested by the Italian police on corruption charges in connection with the most project

193
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,220
Multiple environmental groups, including the World Wildlife Foundation

194
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:43,820
have repeatedly made negative comments about the project

195
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:49,820
and while the supporters of most claim that it will be capable of handling the threats of rising sea levels from climate change

196
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:51,820
many others doubt it

197
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,980
While the gates could always just theoretically be raised to block out rising sea levels

198
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:03,460
they could only do so by raising the gates so often that they probably just end up functioning more as a near permanent wall

199
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,659
By being raised nearly all of the time

200
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,139
the lagoon's natural drainage and interchange with the patriotic sea will be complete destroyed

201
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,940
and the lagoon surrounding Venice will inevitably become just a gross

202
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,419
stagnant pool of garbage and algae

203
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,659
Unfortunately, though

204
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,220
that may be the only possible solution that exists to save Venice

205
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:31,379
It's been estimated before that just a centimeter rise in sea levels will pretty much permanently do venice beneath the waves

206
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,220
And in the famous IPCC report

207
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:41,299
projected a rise of 600 to eleven hundred centimeters in sea levels by the year 20 100

208
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,379
If greenhouse gas emissions remain the very same as they are today, by the end of this century

209
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,100
venice is probably either going to become the 21st century is Alantis

210
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:57,139
or it's going to be stuck inside of a blocked off and stagnant lagoon that's full of algae and trash

211
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,340
And there doesn't really seem to be many good alternative 3rd choices

212
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,580
And throughout all of this

213
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:10,059
the pace of tourists coming to visit the already drowning and crowded the city isn't seeming to go down either

214
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,659
Despite the global pandemic

215
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,539
with pent up global demand for international travel at an all time high

216
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:23,419
the number of tourists who will visit the city in 2025 is projected to soar towards 38 million people

217
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,659
a number that many Venetians consider to be grossly unsustainable

218
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:28,779
That would mean

219
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,620
on an average day in there would be nearly one tourist for every two residents in the small

220
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,419
five square kilometer city

221
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:46,700
These extremely high levels of overturism are creating overcrowding and even further environmental problems for the ecosystem around the fragile lagoon

222
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,139
The entire city of Venice and its lagoon are considered a the World Heritage Site by UNESCO

223
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,500
and because of its rampant over tourism

224
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,019
UNESCO was considering placing the city on its in Danger list

225
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,299
which usually only includes historical ruins in war torn countries like Syria or Iraq

226
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,940
Earlier in June of 2021

227
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:17,500
unesco narrowly avoided placing Venice because the Italian government finally banned the passage of large cruise ships entering in through the city's historic center

228
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,160
But that's pretty much just a minor step in solving venice's tremendous problems

229
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,579
In the end

230
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:29,700
all of the engineering and policies in the world may not be enough to match the overwhelming

231
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,660
fund higher power than nature is bringing to Venice this century

232
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,660
I think that ultimately, save for taking Venice and pushing it somewhere else

233
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,059
I'm not really certain about venice's future

234
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,859
and neither is anybody else

235
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,220
because in the end

236
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:53,940
no amount of technology can possibly overcome the fact that Venice is located on a chain of sinking islands in the middle of a marshy lagoon

237
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,220
while the water besieging it from the outside is getting higher and higher all the time
