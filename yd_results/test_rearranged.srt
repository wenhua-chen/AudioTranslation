1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,379
California's america's largest, most influential and most powerful states

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,240
With the population near 40 million people

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,199
There are more people living in California than in the entirety of Canada

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,820
And with a total economy size of trillion

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,859
california alone would be the world's 5th largest economy

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,890
ahead of even the gigantic India, with 35 times the population

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,629
The two largest engines inside of California

8
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,289
That fuel all of this economic and population success are greater Los Angeles

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,609
in the South, america's 2nd largest urban area, home to approximately 13 million people

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,409
and the San Francisco Bay Area, further to the north, home to approximately eight million more

11
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,770
These are california's two greatest centers of population and financial power

12
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,289
but traveling between both of them has always been a bit of an ordeal

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,869
More than 380 mi away from each other, about the same distance as London is from Dundee Scotland

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,490
A typical drive between Los Angeles and San Francisco takes at least 6 h to complete

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,969
if not even more, depending on the state of traffic

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,890
The only other real alternative choice available is to visit an airport pastor security

17
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,209
board a plane and fly the roughly hour and a half journey between them in the sky

18
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:14,909
Today

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,689
so many people choose this alternative that it has become the 2nd busiest flight route over the entire United States

20
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,730
Not only are these choices time consuming, expensive and annoying to many

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,890
but they're also not exactly ideal for meeting california's increasingly stringent emissions targets

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,329
And that's why, beginning back in the late 1990s

23
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,329
the state of California began seriously looking into the feasibility of adding in a better

24
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,849
more sensible 3rd option between the cities, high speed rail

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,010
which would be a 1st for the United States

26
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,829
On paper, the concept would make an enormous amount of sense for the States

27
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:55,049
It would provide significantly quicker transportation between the two big cities than driving

28
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,689
and was supposed to be a cheaper alternative to flying

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,290
and with numerous stops along the way that would better connect and serve even more of california's population

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:10,770
The benefits of rapid transit between centers of commerce would be more accessible to more people than ever within the state

31
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:13,330
with profound economic benefits

32
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,569
And with more people opting to take the train, over flying or driving

33
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,370
california could also work to cut down on their overalls state wide emissions as well

34
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,050
The proposal to begin construction on the rail was passed by California voters 14 years ago

35
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:26,530
back in 2008

36
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,210
But the trouble ever since then has been that the project is grinding
