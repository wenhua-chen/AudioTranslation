1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Of all the world's continents, australia may be the smallest

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,900
but it's also the only one to be entirely controlled by just a single country

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,699
Almost everybody knows, though

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,060
that while Australia is a huge place in terms of land

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,660
it's also a pretty small place in terms of population

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:25,870
But few people really understand the absolute scale of how sparsely populated the Australian continent actually is

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,070
To help put the numbers in a some perspective

8
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:32,509
australia is of a comparable size to the lower 48 U-S states

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,109
These 48 U-S states have a population of more than three hundred million people

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,469
while Australia only has a population of little more than 26 million

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:50,829
This means that there are two American states that have more people than the entirety of the Australian continents

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,549
california with more than 39 million

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,070
and Texas, with more than 28 million

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,990
For a more European perspective, the population of only England

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,750
without factoring in any of the rest of the UK

16
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,950
is more than double the entire population of Australia

17
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,069
Despite being an entire continent

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,069
There are actually seven significantly smaller islands across the world that have higher populations than Australia

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,840
Great Britain, of course, along with Hanshu Luzan, mindinal Java, sumatra and Madagascar

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,480
Java alone has nearly six times australia's tiny population

21
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,840
despite being an island that is 60 times smaller than Australia the Continents

22
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,879
But it still gets even crazier

23
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:43,280
because there's also a bunch of cities across the world that right now have more people than the entire continent as well

24
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,200
The Tokyo

25
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,680
jakarta and Delhi metropolitan areas all have greater populations than the entirety of Australia

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,760
Well, the Shanghai and Soul metro areas have roughly similar populations

27
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,640
Sao Paulo, mexico City, new York City, cairo, lagos

28
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,959
mumbai and Moscow all have largely comparable metropolitan populations to Australia as well

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,359
And all things considered

30
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,599
australia really only has five actual major cities across their continent

31
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
sydney, melbourne, brisbane, perth and adelaide

32
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,919
which collectively account for the residences of nearly two out of every three Australians

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
Australia is therefore among the most heavily urbanized nations in the world

34
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,849
with the overwhelming majority of the population, around 90 %

35
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:37,449
concentrated into relatively small urban areas that only account for 0.22 % of Australias total land area

36
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,349
with half of the overall population living within just these red areas

37
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,789
and the other half almost entirely living in these blue areas

38
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,710
Overall, around 85 % of all Australians live within just 50 km of the coastline

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,710
meaning that there's hardly anyone deeper into the continents vast interior

40
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:06,889
This unique population distribution creates a lot of fascinatingly bizarre situations across the continents

41
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,050
E.G

42
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,990
this is the Shire of East Pillpara in Western Australia

43
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:12,909
It is roughly the same size as Japan

44
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:16,750
but there's only a bit more than 10000 people who live here

45
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,050
And have half of them just live right here in the town of Newman

46
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,469
It's basically just a small town

47
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,389
but with the space of Japan

48
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,729
Then, perhaps even more strangely

49
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:31,289
there's the pastoral unincorporated area down here in South Australia

50
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:38,310
This dot is the city of adelaide australia's 5th largest city, home to more than million people

51
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:43,530
An Immediately adjacent to this oasis of urban life is the pastoral Unincorporated Area

52
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,889
a territory that's roughly the size of France

53
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,770
but is only home to a whopping 3750 people, making the population density something like 178 kmÂ²

54
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,490
Of land

55
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,530
For every one person

56
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:06,819
That is roughly one aruba's worth of land for every single resident inside of the pastoral unincorporated area

57
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,780
Then there's also Anna Creek right over here

58
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,479
This is a huge territory that's slightly larger than Israel

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,439
and yet it is in a country or even a governmental entity at all

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,899
No Anna Creek is actually just a privately owned cattle ranch

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,740
the largest cattle ranch found anywhere in the world by far

62
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,699
that is only staffed by eight full time employees, according to Wikipedia

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:39,899
So this entire area that's the size of Israel is usually only home to less than a dozen people and around 10000 cows

64
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,759
Australia is really, really, really empty

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,899
And to hammer the point home even further

66
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:51,259
consider the towns of Aspirants on the south coast and Kunonura, near to the north coast

67
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,660
Both of these towns are within the same state of Western Australia

68
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:00,540
and it takes at least 30 5 h of time to drive from one to the other

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,139
across a distance of more than 30 200 km

70
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,740
And along that entire distance in time

71
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:15,019
you'll maybe only drive through a population of less than 70000 people the entire way

72
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,019
For comparison

73
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,300
this drive would be about the same one time and distance is driving from Madrid to Istanbul

74
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,220
across nearly the whole of Europe, where there would be a lot more than 70000 people

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,459
So what is it about Australia that makes it such an overall empty void of people

76
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,819
What is it about this continent that has made everything I just brought up possible

77
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:42,110
Well, the easy answer that I'm sure most of you are thinking right now is the desert

78
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:52,029
DA Everybody knows that Australia is covered in a big old desert with tons of super dangerous animals and insects who would ever want to actually live in most of the country

79
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,910
And while there is some truce to this line of thinking

80
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:02,220
I'm here to argue with you that that's only a small part of the overall population puzzle in Australia

81
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,139
and the full explanation for why there are so few people on this continent is

82
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,339
overall a pretty complicated one

83
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:18,579
Most of the problem stems from the fact that Australia is pretty uniquely cursed when it comes to both geologic and location perspective

84
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,060
Located relatively close by to Antarctica, the frozen continent

85
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,500
the western side of Australia is continuously battered by cold ocean currents coming up from the southern Ocean

86
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:38,699
which means that there simply isn't enough heat to generate large scale evaporation that's necessary to form rain clouds over much of the west

87
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,300
Meanwhile, in the East

88
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:45,620
the Great Dividing Range is australia's largest and longest chain of mountains

89
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,300
and the 5th longest anywhere in the world

90
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,779
These mountains run down the entire eastern side of the continent, from north to south

91
00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:05,420
and their height denies many rain clouds advancing from the Pacific the ability to move move any further into Australia than the immediate and narrow band of land between the mountains and the coastline

92
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Thus

93
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:14,180
a so called rain shadow is cast by these mountains across the vastness of the Australian interior to the west

94
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,379
where moisture coming in from the east understandably struggles to penetrate into

95
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,339
But these mountains, generally speaking, from a global perspective

96
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,620
aren't really all that impressive

97
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,240
Truly big mountains cannot be found anywhere on the surface of Australia

98
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:37,810
And overall, the continent has the lowest average elevation of all of earths continents

99
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,810
which just creates a further, huge problem for rainfall

100
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:48,170
The tallest mountain and highest point that can be found anywhere in Mainland Australia is here within the Great Dividing Range

101
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,370
Now Kaziasco

102
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,970
and it's only 2228 m high above sea level

103
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,850
For comparison

104
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:00,730
the highest point of every single other inhabited continent is at least more than double that height

105
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:13,009
And nearly three quarters of the entire us state of Colorado alone maintains an elevation that is significantly higher than just that one sort of tall mountain in Australia

106
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:23,050
This means that there are simply very few tall mountains to be found anywhere on the continent that are actually capable of forcing air upwards where it's possible to cool into rain

107
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,329
and then to make matters even worse

108
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,649
that air is very often just too hot for rain form anyway

109
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,730
because the continent straddles the boundary of the Tropic of Capricorn

110
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,009
placing a significant amount of northern Australia to be well within the tropics

111
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:40,889
and almost the rest of the continent down on the subtropic

112
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:48,210
This area of the world is dominated by the sub tropical high pressure belt that wraps around the entire glow

113
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,519
and it simultaneously serves to both warm and dry the air around it

114
00:08:53,139 --> 00:09:00,679
So whatever air even does get pushed up by the few tall mountains in Australia has to also contend with this phenomenon

115
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,340
And what's even more

116
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,179
australia has to also contend with the difficult to predict oscillations of the Southern Pacific Ocean

117
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,980
known as El Nino and Lanenia

118
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,460
During an El Nino event

119
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,299
which can sometimes last for years at a time

120
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,500
the Southern Pacific often goes through prolonged periods of slower than usual westerly winds

121
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,659
and that, not naturally

122
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:28,700
means that there will be less atmospheric moisture delivered by those winds to the eastern and northern parts of the Australian continent

123
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,259
often accompanied by exacerbated, drought like conditions

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,860
It's unsurprising, then

125
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:42,940
that many of the worst bush fires in australia's history have taken place at the exact same time as during one of these El Nino events

126
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,059
All of these factors converged to make Australia

127
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,940
by far the dryest inhabited continent on the Earth

128
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,940
with the least amount of average annual rainfall

129
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,980
And consequently

130
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:01,379
desert or desert light conditions understandably exist over about 35 % of the continent continents total area

131
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,059
I mean, just take a look at this map of australia's average rates of annual rainfall

132
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,220
where you can see most of the rain on the continent falls on the east coast

133
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,259
in the stretch of land between the coastline and the Great dividing Range in the north that stretches into the tropics

134
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:17,899
tasmania in the south and around Perth in the southwest corner

135
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,659
It's basically an identical map with australia's current population density pattern

136
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:28,100
except in one very interesting and notable area, northern Australia

137
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,080
The problem up here is not that it receives a low amount of rain on average

138
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,440
but that it receives that rain largely all at once and over ridiculously variable periods of time

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
just like everywhere else in the tropics

140
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,000
Northern Australia is dominated by the wet and the dry season

141
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,399
where rainfall is greater during the summer and less during the winter

142
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,320
In the cave of Darwin, the largest city up here on australia's northern coast

143
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,519
the average annual rainfall amount is more than 1800 mm

144
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,519
which is nearly triple the amount of rainfall that London gets

145
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,600
However, the vast majority of that rain falls during just the four months of the wet season

146
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,960
between December and March, when the areas march soons and tropical cyclones are generally active

147
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,120
And when you discount the immediate coastline

148
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:19,440
the rest of northern Australia and the interior between the coast and the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south

149
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,240
suffers from some of the most highly erratic rainfalls seen anywhere on the planet

150
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:29,559
largely owing to the unpredictable pattern of in the areas tropical cyclones

151
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,179
In 1898, one of these cyclones dumped an absolutely unbelievable 740 mm

152
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,759
Of rain over this small northern Australia town in just a single day

153
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,559
more than the entire average annual rainfall of London

154
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,639
Which could give the false impression, if you just looked at that single year

155
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,240
of more rainfall here than in the UK

156
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,889
But then a few decades later on, in 1924

157
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:01,330
without any cyclones penetrating through to the interior here, this town only received 4 mm

158
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:03,769
Of rain throughout the whole year

159
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:07,529
which is even less than the yearly average of the Sahara Desert

160
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,649
But it's not just the erratic nature of the continent's rainfall that makes fresh water escape

161
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,049
It's also the lack of any decently large rivers

162
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,649
The most significant river system on the continent is the Murray Darling Base

163
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:25,289
and here in the southeast, in one of australia's most heavily populated cores

164
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,690
But it just kind of sucks from a build a big civilization perspective

165
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:35,690
1st of all, the waters of the system flow southwestward and empty out right here on the south coast

166
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,070
This isn't really good, because it's mentioned previously

167
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,649
Most of this basin exists in the part of Australia beyond the Great Dividing Range

168
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,129
that doesn't usually see a lot of rainfall to replenish the rivers with water

169
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:47,860
As a result

170
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:53,620
the average annual flow of the waters in the Basin amounts to just 24000 giga leaders a year

171
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,700
which is the lowest rate of flow of any of the world's greatest river systems

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,740
For comparison

173
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:08,019
the Mississippi Basin in the United States has an average annual flow of nearly 530000 a year

174
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,220
which is more than 22 times the flow of water that australia's greatest river system has got

175
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,980
Nonetheless, it's the best that the continent has got

176
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,940
And the basin provides the drinking water for around 3 million Australians today

177
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,860
while the area around it has developed into the agricultural heartland of the modern Australia nation

178
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:33,539
providing nearly the entirety of the food that the 26 million people of Australia consume

179
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,620
along with enough to export to millions more across Asia

180
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,419
But as climate change continues to worsen the effects of drought in the continent

181
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,019
the waters that feed this agricultural hartland

182
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:49,100
through the Murray Darling Basin, are getting harder and harder to come by

183
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,220
With every passing decade

184
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:58,620
Nine of the ten hottest recorded years in the continents history have taken place just since 2005

185
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,899
These higher temperatures are rapidly increasing the rates of evaporation throughout the waters of the basin

186
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,360
and with already limited rainfall throughout the majority of it

187
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,840
it's making the water here increasingly scarce

188
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,799
with some sections of the Basin, at times, remaining completely dry for months on end

189
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,250
And it's not just the scarcity of fresh water on the continent that makes sustaining a very large population difficult

190
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:29,769
It's also the scarcity of good land for farming in agriculture

191
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:34,730
owing once again, largely to geography, geology and location

192
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,090
In Northern Australia, there hasn't been any new mountain buildings since the pre Cambrian era

193
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,000
that ended one and a half billion years ago

194
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,000
And even further

195
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,080
there hasn't been any glacial activity here since the Carboniferous ended nearly 300 million years ago

196
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,750
Thus

197
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:58,850
this entire region that covers nearly half of the continent has suffered its soils being beneath continuous weathering

198
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,649
an erosion for well over million years

199
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,809
compared to less than 10000 years for most of the soils on other continents

200
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,129
like North America, europe or Asia

201
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:18,389
Therefore, the soil nearly everywhere in Northern Australia just sucks for agriculture

202
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:22,649
The only exception of that rule is the area of the river base in the drains here in Lake Erie

203
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:24,929
But this is an overall small amount of the north

204
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,889
and the rainfall required for irrigation here is still very low

205
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:35,230
But the thing is, none of these geographic or climatic explanations really give the full picture

206
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,470
Because despite everything that I just spent the last 10 min explaining to you

207
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:44,029
it turns out that Australia actually has a ton of fresh water resources

208
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:46,710
well, at least one compared to countries

209
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,110
and not to continents

210
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,669
In fact, australia has an estimated 492 cubic kilometers worth of renewable freshwater resources

211
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:00,220
which is more than a lot of countries with significantly higher populations

212
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,659
That's twice as much as Pakistan, E.G., a country which has more than eight times as many people

213
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,580
So it's not just a sheer lack of fresh water

214
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,659
And it's not just a sheer lack of arable land either

215
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,559
While yeah, only about 6 % of australia's land is actually arable and suitable for agriculture

216
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,159
australia is huge, so that 6 % is still a ton of usable farmland

217
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,820
To put it in a context, australia has more arable land than Indonesia

218
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,580
malaysia, singapore, the Philippines, vietnam

219
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,539
cambodia and Laos all have combined

220
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,019
despite all of these countries having a combined population of 542000000 people

221
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,460
and Australia only having 26 million people

222
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,460
To put it into another perspective

223
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,940
australia has by far the highest ratio in the entire world of arable land to population

224
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,019
at around 1.9 arable hectares of land for every one citizen of the country

225
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,059
For the sake of comparison, the ratio in the United States is only about zero point

226
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,859
47 arable hectares of land per one citizen

227
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:14,920
This means that if Australia ever reached the same ratio of arable land to people as the United States

228
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,240
the continent would be home to well over 90 million people

229
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
still substantially less than the population of America

230
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,440
but also substantially more people than Australia has today

231
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,599
In theory

232
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:35,559
australia does have enough of space and resources to support a lot more people than the 26 million who live there today

233
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:40,920
The big reason why it doesn't is because for pretty much the entire history of Australia

234
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:46,960
right up until the present day, it's just been a really tough place for anyone to actually get to

235
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:52,160
You see, for millions of years now, australia has been effectively a lost continent

236
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:57,079
isolated from all the earth's southern major landmasses, drifting alone out in the sea

237
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,240
This has resulted in millions of years of completely separate evolution for the animals of the continent

238
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,599
which is why australia's unique among earth's continents for the fact that marsupials

239
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:12,839
and not central mammals, dominate the indigenous mammal wildlife species

240
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,640
Modern humans 1st reached the continent sometime around 50000 years ago

241
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,680
when the areas' geography looked radically different than it does today

242
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
with sea levels significantly lower

243
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,960
Back then, humans were able to simply walk down the Sunda Peninsula

244
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,000
pop a few islands, then make it into present day New Guinea

245
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,359
which back then was connected to Australia via land bridge, as the prehistoric continent of Sahul

246
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,000
And after these initial humans made it to the continent

247
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:48,839
they remained almost entirely undisturbed for tens of thousands of years by any other groups of humans from anywhere in the outside world

248
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,799
As sea levels began to rise following the end of the last Ice Age, sohoul was flooded

249
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,480
and the land bridge between New Guinea and Australia fell beneath the waves around 10000 years ago

250
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,440
making Australia even more remote than it had been previously

251
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,940
and even less likely to ever be visited by outside for the next 90 600 years

252
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,539
before the eventual arrival of the Europeans in the 17th century

253
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,940
the Australian continents may have only been significantly visited and impacted by outside humans

254
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,859
a total of just two times

255
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:25,480
Dingoes, an invasive species of dog like the originating from New Guinea

256
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,019
We're introduced to Australia some time around years ago

257
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,339
potentially by an unknown group of human visitors coming from the island

258
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,019
About percent of the modern Aboriginal Australian DNA also derives from Indians

259
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:45,980
which suggests a potential encounter on the continent with a group of humans from South Asia some time around 4000 years ago

260
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,519
And then, after millennia of existing almost entirely undisturbed by the outside world, in 1606

261
00:19:54,119 --> 00:20:01,440
a dutchman and his crew suddenly showed up on their ships and landed right here on the western side of the Cape York Peninsula

262
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,720
But even after that

263
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:09,000
the Dutch never really bothered ever establish any permanent settlements or presence on the continent

264
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,640
because the parts of it that they found were generally decided to be too uninhabitable

265
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,119
For all the reasons I mentioned during the 1st half of this video

266
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:20,440
the closest the Dutch ever came to a permanent settlement on Australia

267
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,200
happened entirely by accident

268
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,569
50 years after their discovery, in 1656, a Dutch ship called the vergoulda Dryak

269
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,009
crashed off the coast of Western Australia

270
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,210
Around here, 75 of the ship survivors miraculously made it to the shore

271
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,569
and then seven of them were dispatched on one of the ship's life boats to make the 14 hundred mile long journey

272
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:43,529
journey over to Batavia

273
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,250
or modern day Jacarta, on the island of Java

274
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:51,170
which was the administrative capital of colonial Dutch rule in Indonesia at the time

275
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,289
After 41 grueling days of travel

276
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:03,809
these seven people finally made it to Batavia and raised the alarm for the 68 crew and passengers who they left behind back in Australia

277
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:05,329
And for the next several years

278
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:12,609
numerous search and rescue missions were carried out by the Dutch Navy all along the Western Australian coast

279
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,450
The little sign of the ship's wreckage was ever discovered

280
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:23,609
and the 68 survivors of the Virgodadraia who were left behind were simply never seen heard from again

281
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:27,210
their ultimate fates remaining a mystery to this day

282
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:33,450
they simply vanished into the vast void of Australia and history without much of a trace

283
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:38,650
More than three centuries of time would pass before finally, in 1963

284
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:52,029
the wreckage of the Virgguda dryac was covered by a team of Australian divers roughly 100 km north of modern day's per Well over a century after the vanishing of the Virgoda

285
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,589
68 on the continent

286
00:21:54,069 --> 00:22:00,269
the British finally established the 1st truly permanent European settlement in Australia only in 1788

287
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,269
over on the complete other side of the continent

288
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,109
around modern day Sydney, with the around 1300 people time

289
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:13,910
The Aboriginal population of the continent was likely only somewhere around 650000

290
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,789
which was pretty much the entire population of Australia as a whole

291
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:26,029
To put that in a perspective, every other inhabited continent on the planet had vastly

292
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,470
vastly more people than that

293
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,390
1788, asia already had more than 650000000 people

294
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,509
around a thousand times the population of Australia

295
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,470
while Europe and nearly 150000000 Africa had 85 million in the Americas had around 20 million

296
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:48,430
Australia therefore began the modern era of industrialization from a far

297
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:54,230
far lower population base than any other of earth's inhabited continents

298
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:56,750
And since population growth tends to be exponential

299
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:00,549
australia has been lagging behind the rest for centuries

300
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:08,210
In 1788, the population of the freshly independent United States stood at around 4 million people

301
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:12,549
It would take Australia, australia more than a century of history, not until the year 1906

302
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:18,549
to finally surpass the population of the United States back in 1788

303
00:23:20,089 --> 00:23:25,490
And by 1906, america's population was already pushing 90 million

304
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,789
For most of australia's history, immigration came almost entirely

305
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,150
clearly from just a single source, the British Isles

306
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:38,569
Following the discovery of gold on the continent in 1851, a massive gold rush to Australians sued

307
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:45,789
That's all around 2 % of the entire population of the British Isles emigrate to Australia throughout the decade of the 1850s

308
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,509
and more than doubled the Australian population almost overnight

309
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,269
But Australia struggled to attract large numbers of immigrants from Europe afterwards

310
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:59,069
because it was heavily competing for them with more attractive countries in the Americas

311
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,950
like the United States, canada, brazil and Argentina, who were much closer to Europe geographically

312
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:10,589
and were thus generally cheaper and quick for Europeans to emigrate to

313
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:18,670
It didn't help that beginning in the Australian government enacted a policy that would artificially reduce their numbers of immigrants to the continent

314
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,549
For decades, the racist White Australia policy

315
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,589
which restricted immigration to only people of white European ancestry

316
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,190
and initially gave overwhelming preference to migrants coming specifically from Britain

317
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,029
As a result

318
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:41,630
the flow of immigrants to the continent remained only a trickle of people for decades across the early 20th century

319
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:42,750
while at the same time

320
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,279
millions of immigrants were arriving in the United States every couple of years

321
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,519
The population of Australia even shrank during World War One

322
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,039
when nearly one in five australia's men were shipped off to fight the war in Europe

323
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:05,880
Around two and a half percent of australia's entire male population of the time never made it back home from the trenches and beaches of Europe

324
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,759
By the eve of World War II

325
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:15,440
australia was a small and overwhelmingly European nation of only around 7 million on the periphery of Asia

326
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:26,660
And many white Australians of the time were terrified of being demographically overwhelmed by the extreme only more populous nations of Asia just to the north

327
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,599
By the time war came to the continent

328
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,039
imperial Japan had more than ten times australia's population, at more than 73 million

329
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,039
And after the Japanese bombed the northern Australian city of Darwin in 1942

330
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,400
fears across the continent were rife that imminent Japanese invasion was coming

331
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,279
And while the invasion never actually materialized

332
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:57,160
the Australian government nonetheless came to believe that they needed to increase their population to avoid the threat of another invasion

333
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,200
Scare like that again in the future

334
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,720
Before 1945, almost all the immigrants to Australia came from either Great Britain or Ireland

335
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:07,960
But after the war, australia, for the very 1st time

336
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,000
began encouraging immigration from across the European continent

337
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,119
The policies restricting immigration, largely only to Britains

338
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,039
were gradually relaxed to be more inclusive of all Europeans

339
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,400
and by the 1960s, 3 million mainland Europeans from places like the Baltic States

340
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,039
poland, italy, the Balkans and Greece

341
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,519
packed up their bags and headed to Australia to begin a brand new life

342
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,720
many of them being displaced refugees from the war

343
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:42,119
But the exclusion of non whites as immigrants of the continent remained large largely enforce for several more decades

344
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,519
even after the war

345
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:50,279
It wasn't until 1973, nearly three decades after the end of World War II

346
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,000
that the white Australia policy was finally overturned

347
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,599
and race ceased being a factor in the continents

348
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:10,319
Immigration policy since Australia has maintained an official policy of multiculturalism and is welcomed large scale multi ethnic immigration for decades from all across the world

349
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:16,880
And now in the 20 st century, the vast majority of new immigrants to the continent come from Asia

350
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,720
and not from Europe, especially from China and India

351
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,039
Today, australia caps the new numbers of immigrants to the continent at less than 200000 a year

352
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:32,970
Which for a country of only 26 million is actually a pretty consistently high rate of immigration

353
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:39,210
As of 2022, nearly one in three people on the Australian continent was born outside of it

354
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:46,650
which is by far the highest proportion of immigrants found in the population of any developed Western nation

355
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:51,130
Australia today is a proud nation of immigrants from all across the world

356
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:56,369
and by 2050, the continents population is protected to increase up to around 36 million

357
00:27:58,369 --> 00:27:59,609
about the same as Canada today

358
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,130
and largely through continued immigration

359
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:07,049
But the growth over the next two decades will not come without its challenges

360
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,730
The continents ancient natural challenges like unpredictable rainfall

361
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,410
dry rivers, droughts and vast arid wilderness

362
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,250
along with new challenges like the uncertain course of climate change

363
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:26,089
mean that Australia has an epic battle against its own environment ahead of it to continue increasing their population

364
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:29,309
But despite all the odds that are stacked up against them

365
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:34,509
the country is actually one of the world's most major agricultural producers and exporters

366
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,309
with more than 104000000 sheep On the continents, there are four times as many sheep as humans

367
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,269
And consequently

368
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:48,470
australia is the world's 2nd largest producer of sheep in wool and the 5th largest producer of beef

369
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,029
Addition

370
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:55,430
australia is the home of slightly more than half of all the world certified organic farmland

371
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,869
and as a global leader in almond and lentils production

372
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,190
And best of all

373
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:05,910
australia's rich culinary culture is heavily represented by the sponsor of this video

374
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:06,750
Hello French

375
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,750
Through the delitious recipes, like their sweet and savory pancakes

376
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:14,390
crumbed pumpkin wedges or Lemington style chocolate brownies

377
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,490
And if you're anything like me, you typically struggle a lot to decide what to do at dinner time

378
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,549
Should I order expensive takeout, eat on healthy freezer food

379
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,990
or make a time consuming, home cooked meal

380
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,799
I struggled with all of these same decisions for years, until I began using Hello Fresh

381
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,720
because it's simultaneously healthy, affordable and best of all, quick

382
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,220
Now, every week

383
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:48,460
I select all of the meals that I want on their app and then a box arrives directly on my doorstep with all of the ingredients needed in exactly the right quantities needed

384
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,180
Not only is this efficient

385
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,259
less wasteful and better for the environment the traditional grocery shopping is

386
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:59,579
but it also instantly cuts out all of your shopping time and the majority of your prep time as well

387
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:05,059
so that you get to focus exclusively on the most fun part, actually cooking

388
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,900
As an example, I just made this incredible Pecan crusted chicken

389
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:12,779
and it took less than 5 min of prep and less than 30 min of actual cooking

390
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,380
All in all

391
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:13,859
Hello

00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,619
