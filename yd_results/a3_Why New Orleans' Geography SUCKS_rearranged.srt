1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
This is the United States

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:02,140
This is Louisiana

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,740
and this is New Orleans

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,400
And without constant human intervention, this city literally wouldn't exist

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,179
It has perhaps the worst geographic location of any major city in America

6
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:18,620
and there are countless reasons why that are all named water

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,690
New Orleans, the city that is almost completely surrounded by water on all sides

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,030
To the north is Lake Poncho Train

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,030
In the center is the Mississippi River

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,810
Into the south and east is the ever encroaching seawater from the Gulf of Mexico

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,329
To make matters even worse

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:40,890
65 % of the New Orleans metropolitan area is located either ats or far beneath sea level

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,250
a greater percentage than even the Netherlands

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,210
which is only about a 3rd beneath sea level

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,289
This means that when you take a look in New Orleans from the side

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,369
it's effectively just a big bowl that's surrounded on nearly all of its edges by water

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:59,570
And whenever the water tips over the sides from either the river or the lake, the city drown

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,850
And to make matters even more severe

19
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:08,849
new Orleans is placement directly at the Gulf of mexico's edge makes it the most frequent target of hurricanes in America

20
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,530
with an 11 % risk of being slammed by one every single year

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,069
Hurricanes make the flooding problem in the city even worse

22
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,849
But that's still not all due to a variety media reasons that I'll get into later in the video

23
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,230
Louisiana's coastline has been losing the war against the water for the greater part of a century

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,950
Now, over the past hundred years, 2000 sq mi

25
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:36,829
Of land has been conquered by the ocean in Louisiana, south that's twice the size of Luxemberg

26
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:43,370
And the ocean's advances are accelerating to the tune of about one football field worth of land every hour

27
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,890
24 h a day, 365 days a year

28
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:55,450
This is putting the ocean and its waters dangerously closer and closer to New Orleans every single hour

29
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:58,609
And it's placing the city on a time bomb

30
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:01,310
Southern Louisiana is slowly drowning

31
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,430
And it ultimately begs the question

32
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,469
since nature seems to think that settling a city here was such an obviously terrible idea

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
then why didn't humans

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,000
The answer to that is because, of course

35
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,919
it never really seemed like a bad location until fairly recently

36
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,930
In fact, for most of Americas and even humanity's history

37
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:29,889
the area around New Orleans was without a doubt one of the most important locations on the entire planet to control

38
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,069
Take a look at the map of the world

39
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:35,050
Pretend that you've just begun a game of civilization, where you're low in the tech tree

40
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:41,409
and look at where the best locations to build a wealth city are going to be on the North American continent

41
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,330
I would argue

42
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:49,409
for the area around New Orleans being historically the number one pick for one incredibly important reason

43
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,090
Despite all the risks of flooding and natural disasters

44
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,009
new Orleans sits near the mouth of the Mississippi River

45
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,889
and by setting up a choke point here

46
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,169
one can fully control all of the trade in transportation flowing into and out of it

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,770
This is vital, because by entering the Mississippi here

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,969
you can travel throughout almost the entirety of the North American interior by way of the Mississippi River Basin

49
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,729
Every single one of these creeks streams, rivers

50
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,930
eventually all flow into the Mississippi and find their way down to New Orleans and the Ocean

51
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,930
Until the advent of modern technology, like railroads, planes or highways

52
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:35,409
it was rivers and waterways all across the world which served as humanity's high speed transportation and trade arteries

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,060
And the Mississippi is the biggest and the most important system of them all

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,819
anywhere on the planet

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,580
In fact

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:52,060
the Greater Mississippi River Basin has more kilometers of navigable internal waterways than the entire rest of the world all combined

57
00:03:52,599 --> 00:04:00,939
Has This fact is enormous because it was basically the world's largest natural transportation system on any continent

58
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,840
That today flows through 31 U-S states and two Canadian provinces

59
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:15,319
This system literally connected almost the entire North American continental mainland to the Atlantic Ocean and the rest of the world from there

60
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:23,939
And all of it could effectively be dominated by whoever controlled just this small show point right near the entrance to the Mississippi River

61
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,600
The French were the 1st big empire who recognized this area's immense strategic value

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,759
and a little over 300 years ago

63
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,240
they founded the small settlement of New Orleans here along the Rivers Curve

64
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,279
where it created a natural levy about one and a half meters above sea level

65
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,250
comparatively higher than the surrounding swamplands that were beneath sea level

66
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,009
The initial small settlement fared well against floods and hurricanes

67
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,569
and a century later

68
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,930
found itself under the possession of a new and future global empire the United States

69
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,529
The Mississippi River and all of its various tributary stretching as far as Denver

70
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,370
minneapolis to Moine Omaha

71
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,250
kansas City in Oklahoma City

72
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,889
enabled millions of American settlers to venture out and conquer the West

73
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:12,649
And they could reach all of these places via New Orleans

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,649
and all of the goods they would end up producing would flow back to New Orleans

75
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,850
As America expanded westwards

76
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,009
the Mississippi River became roughly the device line between East and west within the continental States

77
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,889
and the importance of New Orleans became ever more apparen't

78
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,810
If any enemy power were to gain control of it

79
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:43,970
they could shut the entire river down and effectively cut America in half and block all of the massive volume of trade flowing down it from the dozens of other states that were making new from New Orleans one of the wealthiest cities in the world

80
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:49,329
In fact, by the 1840s, new Orleans was america's 3rd biggest city

81
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:51,410
behind only New York in Baltimore

82
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:57,209
And by the time of the Civil War, it was easily the south's largest and most important city

83
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,689
River Boats and barges easily transported luxury goods like cotton from southern states like Mississippi

84
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:06,970
and industrial goods from northern factories up in Illinois, indiana and Ohio

85
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:11,370
And New Orleans was at the zenith of her power and influence

86
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,050
But after the Civil War, the city's fortunes were dramatically reverse

87
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:24,170
The invention of new technologies like the railroad introduced new transportation and trade routes that largely bypass New orleans' location down in the southeast

88
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,170
As more and more railroads

89
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,769
and later interstate highways for trucks and cars and airports for planes were built

90
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:37,060
the crucial importance of the Mississippi and its various riverways diminished by the 20th century

91
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,540
The Mississippi no longer had a monopoly on Middle america's transportation and trade

92
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,459
and in New orleans's monopoly over a minutes to that system no longer mattered quite as much

93
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,379
By World War Two, new Orleans had plummeted from america's 3rd largest city to only her 15th

94
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,100
and despite reaching the height of her popular in 1960 with about 620000 people

95
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,220
she was no longer even the biggest city in the American South

96
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,019
with cities like Dallas and Houston having passed her up with their much more rapid growth

97
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,300
Thereafter, new Orleans would enter into a slow and steady decline with economic opportunity

98
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,819
Moving on to other parts of the country, new Orleans lost 18 % of her population in only 30 years

99
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,980
Between 19 72000

100
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,180
Faced with a serious demographic crisis like this

101
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,620
the leaders of the city at the time decided that they needed to encourage more growth by developing more land

102
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,220
But the problem with that is that New Orleans was founded as an 18th century outpost

103
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,660
and its expansion from those borders into a modern

104
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,579
sprawling city was always doomed to be severely limited by simple geography

105
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,379
As New Orleans developed around her colonial era core that was on some of the highest ground available in the area

106
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:04,779
she had no other choice but to expand further into the swampy and flood prone lands that were closer to in eventually even beneath sea level

107
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,019
which was a dangerous decision

108
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,300
In order to develop the swamp land even further, the city began draining out all of the water

109
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,139
which caused the soil beneath to compact and led to the modern city above sinking

110
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,160
Today, parts of New Orleans are sinking by as much as 5 cm a year

111
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,300
And when you remember that most of the city is already beneath sea level and right next to several major bodies of water

112
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,620
you can understand why this is all catastrophically dangerous

113
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,820
What makes matters even worse is the fact that sea levels are only rising as time goes on

114
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,179
which is making the bowl shape of New Orleans, surrounded by precarious water on all sides

115
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,779
more and more dangerous as the st century continues

116
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,299
With all of that in mind, let's analyze all of New orleans' contemporary geographic issues

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,259
1st Up Lake Ponter Train

118
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,220
I want you to look at this map of the elevation levels throughout New Orleans

119
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:08,220
And now I want you to look at this map that shows the areas with the most severe flooding from Hurricane Katrina in 2005

120
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:11,860
These really are different maps

121
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,740
but they look almost identical

122
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,460
and the correlation is plain to see

123
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,100
When Katrina struck its powerful winds

124
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:25,620
rapidly shoved water from the Gulf of Mexico into Lake Poncho Train and overflowed it

125
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,940
The levies that were designed to contain it were not built up to standards high enough to overcome this

126
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,019
and many failed

127
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,259
As a result, the water spilled into the bowl that is New Orleans

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,970
and the city was devastated

129
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,350
Over 18 hundred lives were lost

130
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,889
Over a hundred and $50 billion in damage was caused

131
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:52,929
And because of the mass exodus of refugees escaping all of the chaos

132
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,080
the city's population was reduced by more than half of what it had been before

133
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:07,480
The year after Katrina in 2006, new Orleans had been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self

134
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,679
It was then only the 94th largest city in America

135
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,559
and it was the lowest population the city had ever had since the 18 seventys

136
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,960
Over the years since, new Orleans has managed to admirably rebuild

137
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,320
but her population has still, to this day

138
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,100
not ever managed to recover beyond her pre Katrina 2005 population

139
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
It was a catastrophic blow

140
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,679
but hurricanes in the lake are but one of the the many problems that the city is facing

141
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,559
The next is the Mississippi River itself

142
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
Over thousands of years

143
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,559
the mississippi's path has constantly wandered across the landscape of Louisiana

144
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,519
The Mississippi as we know it today has basically only existed since the Middle Ages

145
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,720
and when the French settled the city in the 18th century, they weren't exactly aware of that

146
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:03,539
Beginning around 1900, the mississippi's natural wandering course began to change again

147
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,279
Had it been left to its own devices, without any human intervention

148
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,919
the Mississippi would have by now shifted its primary path over here to the Achafalia River

149
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,870
and what remained of the river through New Orleans would have effectively just become a stream

150
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:16,830
In comparison

151
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:25,149
this would have destroyed New orleans's drinking water supply and rendered her strategic location at the mouth of the Mississippi pretty much obsolete

152
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:31,750
So rationalizing that it would have been pretty expensive to pretty much abandon the city and push everybody over to the Asha Feli

153
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:43,029
The river engineers decided instead to construct a massive series of river control structures further up the river to guarantee that the water would continue flowing into the Mississippi as we know it today

154
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,789
However, some geologists believe that if a future flood is catastrophic enough

155
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:49,509
the system could be overwhelmed

156
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,870
and the Mississippi will find its way over to the Feliah and around New Orleans anyway

157
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:01,009
And the Mississippi poses much more threats to New Orleans than simply diverting itself around it like Lake Poncho Train

158
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,149
The Mississippi also likes to flood a lot

159
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:06,629
and is higher up than a significant amount of New Orleans

160
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,710
so our official levies were constructed along its banks to try and contain it

161
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,350
However, this also had a lot of unintended consequences

162
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:19,389
Chief among them was the destruction of louisiana's coastline

163
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,350
You see that the Mississippi River is chalk full of sediment

164
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,590
which is why the river always looked so brown

165
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,110
But over thousands of years

166
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,950
the river continuously deposited these sediments into the Gulf of Mexico

167
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,549
and compounding over time, created newer and newer marshlands

168
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,909
Immediately before the European discovery of America

169
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,549
this is roughly what the Louisiana coast line naturally looked like

170
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,870
But after New Orleans was established and the levies were constructed along the rivers banks throughout the 19th century

171
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,990
the sediment rich water could no longer reach and replenish any of These are wetlands

172
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,470
and when combined with rising sea in a myriad of other man made causes

173
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,029
they began to rapidly shrink

174
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,149
In the past hundred years alone, louisiana has lost thousands of square miles to the ocean

175
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,110
and it's getting even worse all the time

176
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:08,990
Since New Orleans itself is sinking by about 5 cm a year

177
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,389
and sea levels are rising by about before millimeters a year

178
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,190
the water is creeping faster and closer to the New Orleans Bowl all the time

179
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:20,429
Over the next 30 years, by 2050

180
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:26,669
louisiana is projected to lose about another 50 800 km² of wetlands

181
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,350
and the ocean itself will be pretty much on New orleans' doorstep

182
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:37,100
At this point, new Orleans will be even more surrounded by water than she is today on all sides

183
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,460
which will only increase the odds of catastrophic floods in the future

184
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:42,279
Historically

185
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,059
louisiana's wetlands have provided some kind of barrier of defense between New Orleans and hurricanes rampaging in from the Gulf

186
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,580
But in the future, without

187
00:13:51,299 --> 00:14:00,419
new Orleans will increasingly experience more and more direct impacts from hurricanes that right now have an percent chance of hitting every single year

188
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,820
But because of climate change, hurricanes are happening more and more frequently

189
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,500
so the odds of another big one hitting New Orleans are only going up

190
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:09,620
while at the same time

191
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:16,620
her defenses are growing weaker and weaker with geography abandoning her New Orleans has been forced to result more and more

192
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:22,899
to higher numbers of man made defenses to overcome her now exposed in poor location

193
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:24,740
like higher and stronger levies

194
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,659
floodgates, pumping stations

195
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,259
river controls and dredging up new artificial land to replace their natural wet defenses

196
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:40,899
But the really big problem that New Orleans is going to have to overcome is that rising sea levels and flood risks are not a unique problem faced by them alone

197
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,740
but by dozens of other cities across the United States as well

198
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,220
such as New York, miami and others, who

199
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,860
because they all have bigger populations and economies

200
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,620
will probably be priority targets for any kind of federal flood protection funding

201
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:59,620
So in the end, louisiana itself is one of the most impoverished states in the United States

202
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,259
and without a lot of external federal funding

203
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:12,340
any man made structures they build still just might not end up being enough compared with the overwhelming firepower than nature is bringing to the table

204
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,860
Say, for taking New Orleans and pushing it somewhere else, like near the Asha Fallaya

205
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:21,580
where the Mississippi is bound to probably just end up anyway, sometime in the next thousand years

206
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,429
I'm unsure of New orleans' future and how long the city has left

207
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:31,029
which is a tragedy, because I love New Orleans

208
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,470
But ultimately, in the end

209
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:41,309
there isn't any amount of technology that can overcome the simple fact that New Orleans is technically located within a bowl that's surrounded by water

210
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:47,740
that's getting deeper and deeper and even more surrounded by water with every passing hour

211
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,620
New orleans's future is sadly not certain

212
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,539
A couple weeks ago

213
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,700
louisiana fell victim to its 2nd most destructive hurricane on record, behind Katrina

214
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,700
While the total cost of the damage has not yet been accurately calculated

215
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,220
it will certainly be an excess of $50 billion

216
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:14,159
The storm's devastation left over a million people across Louisiana without power and brought widespread flooding throughout the state

217
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,440
And yet the levies of New Orleans held firm in their defense

218
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,240
A lot of what's happening today is based on what happened yesterday, last week, last year

219
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,279
or even last decade and beyond

220
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,039
With a lot of family around the Gulf Coast and New Orleans

221
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,440
and as someone with knowledge of New orleans' history and geography

222
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,440
the events of Hurricane Ida had me worried and concerned for days

223
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,779
But information on what exactly was happening was hard to come by

224
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,279
In the storms immediate aftermath, I wanted to understand what was happening in New Orleans

225
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,799
That's dear to my heart

226
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,600
but not a place I currently live in

227
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:57,200
And so I began keeping up with the events by reading the frequent short articles that were being posted to Morning Brew every morning

228
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,740
This is what I love the most about using Morning Brew

231
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,680
informative, and, frankly, witty, than traditional news

232
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:14,539
E.g.

233
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,759
while I was writing the script that relied upon many of the Hurricane Ida articles for context

234
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,240
I also got to read about El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as an official currency

235
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,079
how september 11 transformed the American defense industry

236
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,200
and while aluminum prices hit their highest levels in ten years, all because of a coup in Guinea

237
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,039
Since you watch real life law

238
