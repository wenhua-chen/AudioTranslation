1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
more energy will fall on the world's deserts in 6 h than the entire world will consume over the next year

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:14,179
the sahara desert is well known for being the world's largest hot desert, but it's probably a lot bigger than you even realize

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,440
it's nearly the same size as china

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:24,289
it spans across ten different countries in three different time zones, and it gets absolutely massacred by sunlight

5
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,670
this is a map that shows annual sunshine hours across the world

6
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,350
there are some notable hot spots in north america, south america and southern africa

7
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,670
but nowhere gets as much as the sahara desert

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,850
most of this china size chunk of land gets more than 30 600 h of sunlight a year

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,070
within that big chunk is this other chunk that gets more than 4000 h a year

10
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:49,929
for reference, that's nearly four times the amount of annual sunlight the germany gets

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:05,920
most of this is because the sahara desert is a pretty much directly along the tropic of cancer, which means the sun, for a lot of the year, is pretty much directly over it, and b clouds pretty much never form or even exist over the entire desert, which means all that sunlight is never interrupted

12
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:12,980
the sahara, consequently, is the best location anywhere on earth to play solar panels and develop solar farms

13
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,790
so it then begs the question, what if we covered the entire desert with solar panels

14
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:22,109
how much energy would we actually be able to produce, and how would this change our planet

15
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,469
let's take a deep dive for starters

16
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:34,950
let's begin here. this is the wears as that solar power station in morocco, the world's largest concentrated solar power plant currently in existence in a marvel of modern engineering

17
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:43,989
once fully completed an operational the plant will take up an area of 25 kmÂ² and be capable of producing 500 to megawatts of electricity

18
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:52,609
it will even be capable of storing solar energy in the form of superheated molten salt, which allows for further production of electricity even into the night

19
00:01:52,989 --> 00:02:12,610
after investing more than $9 billion into their solar energy objective, morocco aims to create four additional plants similar to this one in the sahara, that will collectively create more than 2000 mw of electricity production, which will be enough to provide for roughly percent of all of morocco's annual electricity needs

20
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:27,169
this project will transform morocco into the world's leading solar energy state, and as the only african country that currently has a power cable link to europe, much of this energy will be exported for profit to the countries of the european union

21
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,159
but all of this energy is created from just five relatively small plants

22
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,229
what happens when we scale things up a bit and think bigger

23
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:46,620
one of the few organizations thinking about sahara solar energy production in the future is the german energy company, desert attack, which happens to be an investor of the moroccan solar energy project

24
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:59,590
according to their research and data taken from the german aerospace center, a solar panel array of just this small size in the sahara could power 100 % of germany's entire electricity needs

25
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:36,610
an array of this size could power the entire european union, while an array of just this size could power the entire world's modern electricity needs, at approximately 18 trillion watts, give or take a bit, considering that a typical solar panel generates roughly 350 watts of power, this earth powering array would encompass around 51.4 billion solar panels, and it would be roughly the same size as the u-s state of new mexico, quite a large amount of land, but it's nothing when compared with the vastness of the then also happens to be incredibly sparsely populated

26
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:51,960
only about two and a half million people live across the sahara, which means that its population density is on a par with siberia, which further means that it's possible to set up huge solar farms like this without too much of a negative impact on the local inhabitants

27
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:59,120
the desert tech project doesn't quite intend on transforming the entire saharan to a solar farm, but it's still quite ambitious

28
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:06,479
the general idea to set up a series of massive solar farms across the sahara's perimeter and deeper into the middle east

29
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:21,939
once constructed, this collection of solar farms will provide for the majority of africas and the middle east electricity needs, while shipping any excess power across cables to europe, that could supply as much as 15 % of the continents in higher electricity needs

30
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,120
this is a real life plan that's undergone significant amounts of research and investment

31
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,600
but why are they only planning on building solar farms around the sahara's perimeter

32
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:38,360
well, while there's lots of obvious benefits to constructing solar farms in the empty sahara, there's also lots of problems

33
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,500
1st of all, the sahara's emptiness itself is both a blessing and a curse

34
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:55,439
on the one hand, it means that almost nobody will have to be relocated or moved off of their land, but on the other hand, there isn't any infrastructure to actually get the map massive amounts of supplies into place in any kind of cost effective manner

35
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
i mean, look at this map

36
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,139
there's only like four roads that even stretch across the sahara from the north to the south

37
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,120
there are huge empty pockets of land across the desert without a single

38
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:13,310
road at all. and some of these areas, like this northwestern pocket of chad, are more than 600 km kilometers away from the nearest road

39
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:22,160
transporting billions of solar panels to a remote area like this will necessitate building countless new, expensive highways or railroads to get them there

40
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,279
and that's why desert tech is only planning on constructing plants around the sahara

41
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:33,060
but let's forget all of that for a moment, and just think about the cost of the solar panels themselves in a this is a harra sized array

42
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:41,399
a pretty average 350 watt solar panel typically cost anywhere between $250 once fully installed on a residential roof

43
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:56,819
today, since we know that it's going to be expensive transporting and installing all of them in the middle of one of the world's most remote locations, we're going to stick with the high cost estimate here and attack on an additional $300 are delivery in infrastructure fees and 250 more dollars for installation fees

44
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,139
conveniently, this math makes the total cost for each 350 wat panel exactly 1000

45
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:15,500
so from there, you can figure out pretty quickly that the 51.4 billion solar panels needed to fit inside of our new mexico sized array that will power the entire planet costa cool $51.4 trillion

46
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,420
for reference, that's approximately 60 % of the entire world's gdp

47
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,720
but it would enable us to immediately switch all of our electricity over to renewable solar

48
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:35,589
so that's pretty cool. all right, then now let's just assume that we've turned on infinite money, and we expanded upon this by filling up the entire sahara desert with solar panels

49
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,420
what is going to happen now

50
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:51,139
well, for starters, if we assume that the solar panels are 100 % efficient, the entire sahara desert will probably now be producing somewhere around the neighborhood of million terawatt hours of electricity per year

51
00:06:51,439 --> 00:07:02,220
so to put that number in a perspective, the entire contemporary human species consumed about 173000 terawatt hours of energy in 2019

52
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,050
and that's not just electricity. that's all energy consumed for everything we did that year

53
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:19,589
a sahara desert covered in solar panels will generate more than seven times the amount of energy that all of the nearly 8 billion humans of the world collectively consume right now

54
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,519
obviously, this would present revolutionary changes to what mankind could be capable of

55
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,279
and not just even closer to a type one cardishev style civilization

56
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:37,500
but this overwhelming power given to humanity by harnessing the entire sahara would also come with some significant costs

57
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,240
the black surfaces of the solar panels dotting the sahara will of course absorb most of the sunlight hitting the sahara

58
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:53,379
only a tiny fraction of that incoming energy will actually be converted into electricity, while the overwhelming majority will be returned back to the environment as heat

59
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:04,019
in turn, this heat will trigger a sort of feedback loop in which the heat amid by the solar panels would create a steep temperature differential between the land and the surrounding oceans

60
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:12,139
this will ultimately lower the surface air pressure and cause moist air to rise and condens into clouds and rain across the desert

61
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:22,509
so by covering the entire sahara with solar panels, will also unwittingly be terraforming the desert sahara into a green sahara at the same time

62
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:36,100
in some ways, this will be good, because it will open up a massive amount of land the size of china to colonization, human settlement, and, critically, for the emerging economies of north africa, extensive economic development for their countries and their people

63
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,669
but in other ways, this will be really bad

64
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:51,389
the amazon rainforest, over in south america is extensively fed and fertilized by dust coming over from the sahara that gets blown across the atlantic, while the atlantic ecosystems themselves also benefit from this fertile dust as well

65
00:08:51,750 --> 00:09:06,370
removing all of the sands of the sahara desert could create a cascade of unforeseen events that could wipe out entire ecosystems in the atlantic, the amazon and probably beyond, and create an epic climate catastrophe, the likes we have never seen before

66
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,639
in summary, covering the entire sahara with solar panels would be epic, but it's also not feasible

67
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,629
it's probably pretty dangerous. and it's not even necessary either
