1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
this is france. now, i know what you're thinking

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:10,759
if you live in spain, italy, switzerland, germany, belgium, the uk, or, god forbid, within france itself, then you already know that you're not very far away

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,919
from france. and if you live somewhere like north america, asia, australia or south america, then

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,989
you know that you live pretty far away from france

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:25,329
except that that 2nd part isn't really true, because the france i showed you at the beginning isn't really the entirety of france

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,329
in reality, france is everywhere across the world, like literally everywhere

7
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:41,689
here's france and north america. here's france and south america and the caribbean, including this island right here that's divided between france and the netherlands, meaning that france and the netherlands actually do share a border

8
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:43,869
it's just not in europe. it's in the caribbean

9
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,070
here's france closer to mexico. here's france around madagascar

10
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:50,750
here's france in the indian ocean, and here's france in the pacific ocean

11
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:57,189
with all of these different locations across the globe, you're probably not as far away from france as you may have thought, if you don't live in europe

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:04,450
inspired by a map i found created by a reddit user named all hale madame, let's take a look at how far away you really are from france

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:16,890
colored in black. is france itself within any of the red zones europe, unfortunately, less than 1000 km away from sovereign french territory, meaning that you could pretty much begin hearing french at nearly any minute

14
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:28,629
areas like nova scotia, new brunzwick, quebec, maine, venice, suela, brazil, madagascar, mozambique and south africa are pretty much all just as far away from actual sovereign france as germany or austria

15
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:38,950
within the orange zone, you're less than 2000 km away from france, which includes the entire northeastern united states, most of mexico, with the entire caribbean and a whole lot of africa

16
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:43,109
these zones radiating out until we're left with this empty patch here

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:02:01,670
across east asia. within this zone, you're pretty safe because you're more than 7000 km away from any french territory, and it's the furthest possible area away from france you can get anywhere on the planet, spanning across most of china, north hurry up, the japanese island of okado, and far eastern russia

18
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,729
now, the various parts of france that exist all over the world, outside of europe, that make all of this possible, are known as overseas france

19
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:15,449
and it's this other part of france that makes france a true global, 21st century great power

20
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:34,590
altogether, these various islands and landmasses outside of europe, at 119386 km² of territory to the french republic, which is 18 % of france's total land area, and is roughly the same size as either north korea or bulgaria

21
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,430
it's huge, and nearly 3 million people live across it all, which is about how many people live in the us state of kansas

22
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:45,590
and it represents about 4 % of the entire french population

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:03:04,270
oh yeah. and that's the thing they're all citizens of france, and therefore citizens of the european union by extension as well, which makes all nearly 3 million of them living in places as far away as the caribbean, south america and the pacific ocean, all capable of voting in both french and european elections

24
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,969
and because of all these territories existing across the globe, france is actually the country with the highest number of time zones

25
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,610
russia, the world's largest country, spans across only eleven time zones, from west to east

26
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:36,469
but france, with her empire across the world, actually spans across 13 time zones that are shared with places as far away as encourage honolulu, los angeles, new york city, rio de janeiro, paris, obviously, moscow, dubai, karachi, vladiva, stock, sydney and auckland

27
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:42,389
it appears that in the 21st century, the sun continues to never set on the french empire

28
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,430
but that's all just kind of begs another question

29
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:53,069
why in the world does france even have an empire but still this vast outside of europe

30
00:03:53,229 --> 00:04:02,110
well, like every other european power, france also got in on the overseas empire game over hundreds of years of progress, with colonies across africa, the middle east in asia

31
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:18,389
but after world war ii, the world stopped being very sympathetic to colonies, and the colonies of france gradually began declaring their own independences, culminating with france's final colony in africa, gibouti in 1977, and the pacific island of vanuatu in 1980

32
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:29,490
what remains are the final of vestiges of the ancient french colonial empire that simply never desired independence for themselves, and have thus remained a part of 21st century france

33
00:04:29,829 --> 00:04:31,629
some of them are totally uninhabited

34
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:44,110
are really only home to seasonal scientists like clipperton island here in the pacific, the various islands of the southern and antarctic lands and adeliland francis claim over antarctica that grants them direct access to the south pole

35
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:52,089
but all the other places are actually inhabited by permanent populations of people, and some of them are really hugely important places

36
00:04:52,430 --> 00:05:03,430
there's reunion island, way out here, over by madagascar in the indian ocean, with a population of more than 850000 people, which alone is more than two actual eu member states, malta

37
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:08,470
and luxemberg, and nearly as much as a 3rd cyprus, nearby

38
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:15,069
mayote has an additional population of more than 270000, meaning that there's over a million french citizens

39
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,170
living in the indian ocean. were by madagascar in africa

40
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,560
both islands are a fully fledged integral part of france

41
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:30,029
they use euros, and as such, they're the outermost region of both the european union and the eurozone, like two distant moons orbiting

42
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:39,120
around their faraway planet. reunion is one of the few locations the europeans discovered across the world that was actually truly uninhabi back at the time

43
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,680
and the french acquired it back in the 17th century and have simply kept it ever since

44
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:56,120
but there's other big locations in frances overseas territories too, like french kiana, way over here in south america, just like reunion, french kayana is an intangural part of france that uses euros and is part of the european union

45
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:34,319
despite bordering brazil and containing part of the amazon rainforest, this little chunk of europe and france and south america isn't really so little, though, because it's nearly the same size as austria and one 7th the size of metropolitan france itself, back in europe, albeit with a pretty little population of only about 300000 people, which means that the population density throughout is on a par with that's because nearly 99 % of french guiana is completely covered by forests, including the guiana amazonian park, which alone takes up more than 40 % of french guiana, and is, hilariously, the largest national park of the european union

46
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,360
despite, well, you know, being located in south america

47
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:46,600
french guiana is immensely important to both france and europe today, because it is the primary launch site for rockets of the european space agency, are esa

48
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,600
and it's specifically because of french geographic location

49
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,120
look at this map of the world, and then think to yourself, where are the best locations possible to blast rockets off in a space from

50
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,720
the correct answer is as close as you can get to the equator across the earth's center

51
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,740
and it's because here along this line, the planet is rotating faster than anywhere else

52
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:15,860
rockets need all the speed they can get in order to break out of our gravity, and the earth's natural rotation speed can give them a much needed boost

53
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:24,379
unfortunately for europe, the equator runs pretty considerably far away from their continents, which makes blasting rockets off from there a little more challenging

54
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,480
but fortunately for europe, they spent centuries taking over colonies in other parts of the world

55
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,319
and it turned out that french guiana, in particular, is located really, really close to the equator

56
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,139
and so that's how this little chunk of south america became europe's most important spaceport

57
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:51,300
it's so important that at one point back in the 1990s, the guiana space center alone accounted for more than a quarter of french guiana's entire gdp

58
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:11,720
all right, so moving on over to the pacific, france retains possessions of hundreds of islands and talls across french polynesia, in caledonia, wallison, futuna and clipperton island, including the island of bora, bora, inside a french polynesia, which is one of france's most popular tourist destinations, despite being located on the complete opposite side of the world from paris

59
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:23,120
but the pacific part of france carries a darker secret than the other parts of overseas france does because it was here that france primarily conducted their decades long nuclear weapons testing

60
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:34,320
back in 1960, when the french empire still spanned much more of the globe, france became the 4th country to successfully test in detonated nuclear weapon, after the united states, soviet union and united kingdom

61
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:43,299
but they did so initially within the empty deserts of algeria, awkwardly, at the same time that algeria was fighting a war against france for their own independence

62
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:57,519
france would go on to detonate a total of 17 nuclear weapons inside of the empty deserts of algeria before it became an independent nation, after which, they subsequently refused to continue allowing france to test their nukes there, so still one in a test their bomb somewhere

63
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:11,139
they began looking for alternatives. one such idea was to begin testing them on the uninhabited clipperton island, nearby to mexico, but this was ruled out because of the island's intense level of remoteness, and also mexico probably would have had a thing or two to say about it

64
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:26,460
eventually, france settled on continuing their nuclear weapons testing over in french polynesia, where a total of 193 three detonations would be carried out in the pacific ocean nearby, which brought france directly into conflict with nearby new zealand in 1985

65
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:37,720
back then, the organization greenpeace orchestrated a campaign against the continued french nuclear testing in the area with a boat called the rainbow warrior, which was docked in port inside of auckland

66
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:50,720
new the ship was about to depart towards french polynesia to protest against a planned french nuclear test, when two undercover french operatives secretly snug on board, planted a bomb and then blew the ship apart

67
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,840
the explosion sank the ship and killed a green piece photographer who was on board

68
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,980
the french agents were quickly apprehended afterwards by the new zealand police, and were each sentenced to ten years in prison for manslaughter

69
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,139
they would ultimately only serve for two years before being freed by the french government

70
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,149
many political figures

71
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,759
especially in new zealand, have consistently referred to the action ever since as an incident of french states sponsored terrorism

72
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:32,899
and france would ultimately agree to pay million dollars in damages to greenpeace, along with million dollars to the new zealand government as an apology, and a further half a million dollars to the photographer's family as compensation

73
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:57,120
france would continue testing nuclear weapons in polynesia for eleven more years, until in 1996, the year of their final detonation, and ever since, they've switched to using computer simulations for their nuclear weapons testing instead, and today, france maintains an arsenal of approximately 300 nuclear weapons, the 3rd largest arsenal in the world, after the united states and russia

74
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,720
so that was one the reason that france kept much of their overseas empire

75
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:14,419
but overall, the biggest reason why france maintains the overseas empire up to the present is because of the control that it gives france and the european union as a proxy over the world's oceans

76
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:34,919
you see, under the terms of the united nations convention on the law of the sea or unclose, any country may claim an exclusive economic zone or eeg of the water surrounding their sovereign coastline, the country making the claim retains the sole and exclusive legal authority for all fishing, drilling, mining and all other economic activities

77
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,460
and because of there are hundreds of islands and territories that are scattered across all the corners of the earth

78
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:52,960
france actually possesses the modern world's largest eeg, and therefore the largest maritime territory of any 20 st century nation, ahead of even the united states and australia

79
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:07,679
france's eeg spans nearly 11.7 million km² of ocean, across the bay of this sky, the indian ocean, while almost completely surrounding madagascar, huge blotches of the pacific ocean, and even a tiny little sliver here just south of canada

80
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:18,419
these small islands are st pierre and megalone, and despite being located right next to newfoundland and canada, they're a part of france, then home to more than french citizens who all use years

81
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,279
they are the small, final remaining vestiges of the old colonial new france in the americas

82
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,820
and they have a fascinating history of control

83
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,320
when france was defeated in the seven years war back in 1763, they were forced to seed all of their north american possessions over to the british

84
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:42,039
but since the british continued to grant the french fishing rights along the newfoundland coast, they allowed them to keep the tiny islands as a little fishing outpost

85
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:51,120
when france supported america during the american revolution, burton invaded the islands, raised the settlement and exiled the entire french population back to european france

86
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:58,379
out of spite, burton tried to bring in british settlers to repopulate the islands, but then the french came back and sacked the british column

87
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,080
eventually, the british gave the islands back to france once again in 1802

88
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,080
but then, after war with napoleon interrupted, they reoccupied them again the very next year, in 1803, when the napoleonic wars were concluded

89
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:22,960
eleven years later, and 18 and 14, the british once again gave the islands back to france, but then occupied them again in 1815, when napoleon briefly returned to power in france, and then gave them back to france yet again, after he was defeated after waterloo, for good

90
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
and theyve been french ever since

91
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:34,320
during the 1st world war, all of the men on the islands were drafted, and about 400 went on to serve on the western front in europe, where a quarter of them would die

92
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:48,440
when the topic of eegs came up in the 1970s, france initially claimed a huge one for the tiny little islands that severely interrupted nearby canada's e-e-z, which led to a very long legal dispute between both countries over fishing rights

93
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,159
it was only eventually settled in 1992 when france accepted the significantly smaller and narrower boundaries of the current eeg here

94
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:08,019
but it's still kind of weird, because now the french control this zone where they're the only ones who are allowed to fish, and it's completely surrounded by the zone where the canadians are the only ones who are allowed to fish

95
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,139
so canadian fishermen have to always move around it, and local french fishermen are always confined within it

96
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:25,799
but when zooming back out again to see the full picture, francis, the oceanic territory, all combined across the world, is larger than the entirety of the european continent itself

97
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:41,039
and france possesses 8 % of the entire world's e easy areas, despite the fact that france itself only possesses zero point 45 % of the world's land and only 84 % of the world's population

98
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:56,720
if you were to combine both land and maritime area for every country in the world, then france, all of a sudden ranks as the world's 5th largest country, beating up places like brazil, china, india or indonesia, which is, frankly, just ridiculous

99
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:04,080
and it all gives france and, by extension, the european union an enormous global geopolitical advantage

100
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:21,230
when also factoring in spains, portugals, the netherlands and denmarks overseas territories, the european union's collective e-e-z enables it to dominate the entire baltic control, nearly the entire mediterranean and the eastern north of atlantic, and have outposts across every ocean and every

101
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:23,039
corner of the globe, after

102
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,259
the united kingdom and the united states

103
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:46,139
france even further maintains the 3rd largest amount of overseas military bases outside of their home territory, with bases all across their overseas possessions in south america, the caribbean, indian and pacific ocean, with even further bases across many of their former colonies in africa, like jibouti, ivory, coast, gabone, senegal, mali, chad, niger

104
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:53,700
additional bases across the middle east, in syria, iraq, jordan and the uae, and a final two more inside of germany

105
00:15:53,879 --> 00:16:08,720
altogether, france maintains a force of more than 36000 soldiers deployed to these territories across the world, and ever since, the french have initiated military interventions across these nine countries on two separate continents

106
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:19,379
the presence of these french military bases and soldiers all across the world, from south america to africa, the middle east and the pacific gives the french a very similar capability the united states

107
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:26,720
they can project power and deploy military assets at a moment's notice to counter almost any threat anywhere on the planet

108
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:43,539
so when you look at a map like this, you realize that the global french, and therefore the global european empire, is very much still alive and well in the 21st century, and as as a result, france and europe are probably a lot closer to you than you may have realized

109
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:52,039
but something else you may haven't realized yet is just how much you're probably over paying for your current cell phone plan, and how much you could save by switching over to team

110
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,799
i personally switched over to team myself a few months ago

111
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:02,960
and why? well, because of this, yep, that's actual a real phone bill that i received for my old carrier right before i made my switch earlier this year

112
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,980
but team mobile has three different plans to choose from to make sure that never happens again

113
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:15,799
unlimited talk in text starts at just $10, and then datas $5 a gigabyte, or you can just get their unlimited plan for just $45

114
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
they've also got other plans with five or twelve

115
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:26,279
it invites data, but regardless, the point is that you can get the same service you have right now with the same phone number you have right now, for much less money

116
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,420
so if you've ever got a bill like mine, your service probably won't change

117
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,920
it's pretty much a no brainer

118
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:43,839
but what should really seal the deal is that when you click the button that's on your screen right now or follow the link that's down in the description, you'll get totally free $25 credit, enough for an entire month of service on some of their plans

119
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,660
