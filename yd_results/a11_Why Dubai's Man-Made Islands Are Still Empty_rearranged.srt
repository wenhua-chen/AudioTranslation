1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,879
In the early 2000s

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,740
real estate developers saw an enormous opportunity in creating artificial land off the coast of Dubai

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,339
The real estate boom in the emirate seemed unstoppable

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,179
and the demand for ocean properties was huge

5
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,109
Dubai had already expanded along most of its coast

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,070
Soon, the Keel Properties, a real estate company owned by the government of Dubai

7
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,629
made plans to radically change the region

8
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:32,659
All Within just two decades, the company plant freed different island projects that

9
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:35,979
when viewed from space, should represent the shape of palm trees

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:42,509
palmjamira, palm, jabil Elise and lastly, palmdera

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,770
by far the largest one in addition, the world, was announced

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,170
Different areas were plant, from low density housing

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,210
high density complexes and islands that can be used commercially

14
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,920
In a 2nd phase

15
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,859
the world was planned to be supplemented by a never even bigger project the universe

16
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:12,379
Man made islands were planned that resembled the shape of the Sun, the moon

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,959
as well as the planets of the solar system, the Milky Way

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,930
and a distant galaxy next to Palm Jabo Elise

19
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,810
Another gigantic project was to be created the Dubai Waterfront

20
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:35,069
These islands should be formed like a star in crescent, an important symbol in Islam

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,230
And the construction project was advertised as the largest man made development project worldwide

22
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:47,739
The shape should also serve as a shelter to protect Palm Jabo Elise from erosion

23
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,989
With all of these projects, most of the coast of Dubai would have been transformed

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,950
as on one side, the emirate of Abu Dhabi begins

25
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,189
and on the other side there is the emirate of Shajah

26
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:09,009
In retrospect, the level of confidence with which these projects were advanced is astonishing

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,819
But the islands were seen as prestige projects that served a larger goal of developing Dubai into a major tourist hotspot

28
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:21,900
and thereby creating new income sources for a place that gained most of its wealth for the extraction of oil

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Now let's take a look at what happened to these ambitious plans

30
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,409
In 2001, nickele Property started building the Palmjamara

31
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:40,379
This project alone would double the length of the coastline of Dubai

32
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,020
In 2006, the land reclamation was completed

33
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,620
and the 1st apartments were already handed over

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,460
The strands of the palm mainly host private houses

35
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:57,620
while a number of larger luxury hotels were built on the breakwater ring around the palm that protects the palm from storms

36
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,129
While Palm Jamaro was still under construction, over projects started to take shape

37
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:09,129
The st century seemed to have reached a new peak in the rate of growth of Dubai

38
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,289
The real estate market experienced a rapid boom

39
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,930
and a number of prestige projects, such as the Bourge Califa

40
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,610
the largest building in the world, were built

41
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,050
In September 2008

42
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:27,169
The Atlantis Hotel on Palmjamira celebrated its opening with a firework show on the entire palm

43
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,189
But the celebrations couldn't change that

44
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,650
The international financial crisis started to affect Dubai

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Just last week, dubai spent $20 million for a party to open the Atlanta Hotel

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,639
The headline was, dubai Parties

47
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,719
As the rest of the world reels from the economic crisis, perhaps not anymore

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,080
Dubai has been hit by the global financial crisis, especially in real estate

49
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,000
Mega projects like the Artificial Island off the coast are in danger of collapse

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Many construction sites have shut down due to a declining demand

51
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,319
The price of plots of land fell rapidly

52
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:18,009
In a development of Palm, jabo Elise came to a standstill in 2011

53
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,189
The Keel properties offered investors refunds

54
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,550
and a project has been done hold ever since

55
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,170
The empty sand banks that reach 7 km

56
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,610
or 4.3 mi, into the sea appear strangely forgotten

57
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,870
The palm is located behind the jebel Elise port, with no city development near it

58
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,509
and most of the visions dreamed up by the project planners seemingly evaporated in a pluff of sand

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,959
The land reclamation of the Dubai waterfront is nowhere near as advanced

60
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,600
but you can already see the shape of some of the islands on satellite images

61
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,829
This project as well, has been discontinued

62
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,589
A similar situation exists with Palmdera

63
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:03,069
The land reclamation had already progressed

64
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,550
but it is far from complete

65
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,540
In 2014, the Keel decided to try to save this project by rebranding it

66
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,420
Instead of continuing to create new land

67
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,019
the project was scaled down and is now just called Darra Islands

68
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,170
and there is current construction work underway with a plan mall to high rise buildings in a shopping street

69
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,009
Finally, the world the land creation was mostly completed

70
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,730
and a large part of the islands had already been sold before the financial crisis

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,079
but the islands were just not developed further

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,160
as many of the investors that bought them were facing their own problems in the aftermath of the financial crisis

73
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,519
And although investments into new projects in Dubai increased after the crisis

74
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,519
the World Project couldn't benefit from this

75
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,839
as there was less confidence on the return on any such investments

76
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,430
Ten years after the initial project reveal, the world already seemed to no longer fit

77
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:11,959
In the current time, many concerns about the longevity of the project arose

78
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,879
as news reports stated that the smaller channels between the islands started to send up

79
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,800
and the rising sea levels are growing danger for project like this

80
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,680
In general, growing concerns around land reclamation projects came up

81
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,649
Residents at Palmjamera criticized their water quality

82
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,170
While the breakwater is necessary to protect the palm from erosion

83
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,050
it also hinders the natural tidal movement

84
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,449
and seawater within the palm became stagnant

85
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,560
Additionally, environmental concerns got more attention

86
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,040
piling up hundreds of thousands of tons of sand on a seabed that previously had been almost evenly flat

87
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,439
Has an impact on marine ecology

88
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:00,689
The islands are composed mainly of sand that was stretched from dubai's shallow coastal waters

89
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,529
and there are concerns that this leads to a destabilization of the coastal soil

90
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,730
which could lead to an erosion of the natural coastline

91
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,810
Even if these consequences have been known for a long time

92
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:18,769
it is becoming increasingly difficult to market projects that are considered environmentally harmful

93
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,819
Many of the projects promoted in recent years are therefore trying to incorporate environmental compatibility

94
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,490
In addition, the difficult living conditions of migrant construction workers in Dubai

95
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,529
is a topic that is receiving more media attention

96
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,629
Nevertheless, there are development projects on these islands that are starting to take shape

97
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,259
Initially, there was only one island that had been developed

98
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,129
The villa served as a showhouse to promote the project

99
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:00,170
In summer 2012, the Royal Island Beach Club opened on Lebanon Island

100
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,930
The club hosts daytime tourists that can get there by boat

101
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,250
The biggest project, however, was announced in 2014

102
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,399
An Austrian real estate investor plans to develop a number of projects on the European Islands

103
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,959
The project is called The Heart of Europe

104
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,519
and the goal is to create kind of a mini version of Europe

105
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:27,379
with luxurious hotels that are inspired by places like Venice or Monaco

106
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,660
in addition to a number of restaurants with European food

107
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:34,179
the investor also plans to build a plaza on the Swiss Island

108
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,870
where there will be artificial Snow, the project is currently under construction

109
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,470
and time will tell whether it will bring the desired economic success

110
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,879
There are risky development projects almost everywhere in the world

111
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:51,409
and everywhere in the world

112
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:52,330
Some of them fail

113
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:54,289
In urban development

114
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:05,169
prestige projects often serve a greater world than being financially successful by their own as they can attract tourists to a region and therefore support the greater local economy in a variety of ways

115
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,120
In addition to attracting tourism, such prestige projects also often serve as national pride

116
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,879
or they intend to symbolize the start of a new era, e.g

117
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,120
by using new construction methods or by breaking world records

118
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:22,210
If to bias question for creating planned landmarks

119
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,690
then the same criticism must certainly be applied elsewhere as well

120
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,019
But still

121
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:35,700
the question remains how these projects that change the coastal landscape of Dubai will be viewed in retrospect at a time when dub ice growth slows down

122
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:41,860
and when the ambitious dream that this city represents stops being built and just has to be lived

123
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,950
Thank you so much for watching

124
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,850
I recently received a package from Youtube with the Silver Creator award

125
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,850
and so I just wanted to use that as an opportunity to say thank you

126
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,809
There are many more videos in production
