1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
venice is one of the world's most well known and visited cities, with over five and a half million tourists who visited and stayed the night

2
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:11,759
in 2019, venice received 21 times as many tourists as our native population

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,869
and despite only being home to about 26000

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:26,329
people, about the same number as live in lubbock, texas, venice has visited more more often than cities that are significantly larger, like moscow, madrid, munich, johannesburg or toronto

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:45,390
to put it into another perspective, during 2019, the city of venice, with a population that's not even 260000 people, received 86 % of the same number of overnight tourists as the entire country country of brazil did, with a population of over 212000000 people

6
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:51,530
there's just something magical about this small city that's captured the imagination of generations across centuries

7
00:00:51,829 --> 00:01:07,489
perhaps it's the fact that even now in the 21st century, it's remained the final large urban environment in europe that is survived without cars, trucks, and as continued to rely instead upon simple walking in boats, as they have for thousands of years

8
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:21,430
or perhaps it's the sheer and ancient beauty of the canals and buildings themselves in the city that many consider to be a living museum, full of masterpieces from a bygone era that still speak to our souls today

9
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,329
but unfortunately, both are venice and the world

10
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:33,030
venice has two massive problems the entire city is drowning and too many people are coming to watch it die

11
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,609
these are all video clips that have been taken just in the past few years of a city at war with water

12
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,989
and the water has been getting stronger and stronger

13
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,409
recently, venice has been getting flooded more than 60 times a year

14
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:54,469
and during the the worst of these floods, as much as 80 % of the entire city could find itself a little bit underwater

15
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,530
and then there's the number of people coming to see it before the pandemic shut the world down in 2020

16
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,349
2019 was the peak year for tourism in venice

17
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,409
while five and a half million tourists visited and actually spent one night within the city

18
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:14,409
that year, 19 million more tourists visited and spent less than a day there

19
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,250
and venice itself is really tiny

20
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:24,210
it's only about 5 kmÂ², an area with nearly 26 million people visiting in a single year

21
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:31,810
that means that at any given time in 2019, there was nearly one tourist for every three residents in the city

22
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:36,689
these problems have been getting worse and worse every year now for decades spots

23
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:45,990
in order to fully understand why this is happening now, and what's being done to save the city, you've got to understand some of the city's history

24
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:54,550
1st of all, the strategic location of venice on an island in the center of a lagoon has long offered its security and protection from outside powers

25
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:01,569
before the 5th century ad the lagoon itself was a relatively isolated and swampy backwater of the roman empire

26
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:09,789
but when the huns and germanic peoples began their invasions of the italian peninsula, it generated one of the ancient world's greatest refugee crises

27
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:15,729
and many of these refugees sought the precious safety that was offered inside of the venetian lagoon

28
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:31,750
the lagoon is the largest wetland or marshy environment found anywhere around the mediterranean sea, and the dozens of island scattered across it that rise above the shallow water offered immensely valuable protection across the water from the marauding bands of germans and huns back over on the mainland

29
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:40,169
and over time, the lagoon itself would become the well protected cradle for one of the most powerful and influential civilizations in history

30
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:49,530
for out of these islands gradually evolved the absurdly rich venetian republic and her massive maritime commercial empire

31
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:55,090
the lagoon itself offers multiple advantages for the home base of a maritime based civilization

32
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,409
the waters around the city provide a natural moat that any would be invaders have to successfully cross

33
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:18,449
1st further, the waters around the city inside of the lagoon are generally calm because it's a shallow bay that's almost entirely enclosed from the rest of the mediterranean sea, with only these three possible entrances from the outside, meaning that the lagoon is a fantastic natural harbor for parking ships

34
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:33,680
in the position of venice inside of the safety of the lagoon, and the position of the lagoon at the very tippy top of the adriatic sea enabled the city an incredibly safe base of operations from which to build ships in peace, and from which to launch them out in war

35
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:44,949
this geographic advantage enabled the city of venice, over time, to dominate the entire adriatic and from there, over time, the entire mediterranean sea as well

36
00:04:45,370 --> 00:05:01,930
eventually, by the 14th century, the city had constructed the venetian arsenal, a massive shipyard that, at its height, took up 15 % of the entire city and was the largest industrial complex found anywhere in europe prior to the industrial revolution, by almost independently inventing

37
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:05,990
the assembly line. nearly 600 years before henry ford

38
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:43,949
the venetians were capable of producing fully equipped merchant or naval vessels at a rate of one every day, something that was completely unprecedented anywhere else in the world in the medieval and renaissance eras through this process, granted by their geographic advantages, the venetians eventually assembled a fleet of more than 3000 ships, which they, at 1st used to completely safeguard their city, surrounded by a moat separated from the mainland, and then to dominate the entire adriatic and mediterranean seas, carving out colonies across the asiatic coast, along with a sizable chunk of greece and cyprus

39
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,750
by dominating the mediterranean, the venetians completely monopolized the flow of trade coming into europe from the east

40
00:05:51,009 --> 00:06:02,910
and with their interesting location just south of the strategic brenner pass through the alps, they could easily funnel their goods both across italy and north through the mountains to germany and beyond, to the rest of europe

41
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:09,449
venice's geography all but guaranteed that it would become medieval europe's principal center of commerce and trade

42
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,329
and it quickly became the wealthiest city on the entire continent

43
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,930
but it a series of increasingly unfortunate events completely changed the entire calculus of power

44
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:34,670
1st of all, the venetians, all on their own, decided to confront the significantly more powerful and rising ottoman empire, and lost against them, repeatedly, gradually losing more and more of their colonial possessions across the mediterranean in the process

45
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:50,209
2nd venice's strategic location that enabled it to dominate trade from the east was only as good as the knowledge of the world map, and as the portuguese began exploring more and more of it in the 16th century, they were able to completely undermine venice's prior advantage

46
00:06:50,370 --> 00:07:06,050
venice had spent centuries concentrating on building galleys that were light upon oars, the perfect ships for moving across the calm waters of an inland sea like the mediterranean, but pretty terrible for moving across the unpredictable and often harsh waters of the open ocean

47
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:14,569
venice was unable to adapt and therefore became locked inside of the mediterranean and missed out on the european rush for colonies across other continents

48
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:23,810
and when the portuguese discovered the cape of good hope for the europeans, there, larger and more ocean worthy ships ended up dominating the indian ocean itself

49
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:33,589
and the trade from the east shifted towards portugal and other powers from there forever, destroying venice's prior monopoly and the source of her vast wealth

50
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:49,970
venice's influence waned and waned across the following centuries until venice itself was conquered by the french, and then passed back and forth between them and the austrians for a while before finally becoming a part of the modern nation state of italy itself for more than five centuries

51
00:07:50,129 --> 00:08:01,389
now, since vasco togama discovered the cape of good hope and opened up the in the ocean directly to european trade, venice has never again managed to regain its prior historical significance

52
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:10,759
and now today, in the 21st century, the city is facing these new modern crises that threaten its entire existence once again

53
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,019
let's begin with a flooding issue

54
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,899
obviously, a city thats literally surrounded by water like venice will have a flooding problem from time to time, much like new orleans in the united states

55
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,800
but venice is located in a uniquely flooded, vulnerable area

56
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,560
it's located in the lagoon at the very top of the adriatic sea

57
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:46,179
while the adriatics long narrow, when rectangular shape amplifies the natural tides moving up it, meaning that the adriatic naturally has substantially more extreme tidal events than the rest of the mediterranean does, and the adriatics pretty much funnels them all up right towards venice

58
00:08:46,519 --> 00:09:00,279
further, the strong northbound winds in the area, whipping off the adriatic blow directly only towards the three connections between the lagoon and the sea, which can significantly slow down or even totally block, the water outflow from the lagoon into the sea

59
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,000
and when that happens, the eb of water is blocked inside of the lagoon

60
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:10,559
and the next high tide that comes in overlaps with the previous one, which just kind of perpetuates this vicious, self supporting site

61
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:26,440
make matters even worse. venice is located at top the adriatic tectonic plates, which is currently in the process of shifting beneath the italian coast, meaning that venice is naturally sinking and losing elevation in an area that's already highly prone to flooding

62
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,279
but in addition to these natural problems, humans have of course, been making even more man made problems for themselves as well

63
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:49,139
had the venetian lagoon simply been left to itself into nature over the past thousand years, it probably would have completely filled up with silk by now because of the various major sediment rich rivers that used to flow into it, and venice would have been more or less loosely connected to the mainland

64
00:09:49,360 --> 00:10:02,519
the medieval venetians well aware of this problem, and unwilling to allow venice's greatest offensive asset to be destroyed like this, they began diverting the rivers away from the lagoon to keep the sediment out and to keep venice enclosed by water

65
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:11,320
over time, this made the waters inside of the lagoon deeper and deeper and increase the scale of venice's moat and and therefore increase their safety from the mainland

66
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,429
but it also made flooding of the city itself worse as well, because, well

67
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,240
you know, there was just a higher volume of water around it

68
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,629
and then in the 19th century

69
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:33,799
the italians built a railroad bridge the connected venice over to the mainland, and this was even further expanded in the 1930s by the construction of a road bridge alongside of it, all of which significantly modified by the natural motion of the water inside of the lagoon

70
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:42,179
and in the 20th century, the italian government created an industrial district immediately behind venice, and it made the flooding problems even worse

71
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:51,440
previously, to the industrial districts construction, the area was covered by several small islands just above sea level that acted pretty much like natural sponges whenever high time fights came in

72
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,629
but the government completely destroyed them by filling the entire

73
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,659
area in to cover it all up for industry

74
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:06,399
and to make matters more worse, a navigable channel was dug across the lagoon that allowed large, modern oil tankers to reach the new industrial district

75
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:20,059
this artificial channel directly connected the lagoon with the sea, which obviously exist at the time of venice's foundation, thousands of years ago, and it's just become another entry point for high tides and storm surges coming into the lagoon from the adriatic

76
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:26,720
modern studies have indicated that venice is still sinking at a rate of about one to 2 mm per year

77
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:39,519
and over the past decade, global sea levels were rising at a rate of about three millimeters per year, meaning that venice's actual sea level rise is above the global average because of their sinking problem

78
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:51,059
back when modern flooding records of venice began in 1872, there was only one severe flooding event before 1950 in the city, where the water reached a height of meters above sea level

79
00:11:51,240 --> 00:12:02,799
from 1950 until today, however, which is nearly an equivalent amount of time, there have been 21 of the severe flooding events recorded, with more and more happening every new decade

80
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:17,639
of the top ten highest floods measured in venice since records began, four of them took place in 2019, and the biggest of them, in november, was so large it covered more than 80 % of the city and damaged multiple cultural heritage sites

81
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,039
in fact, the centerpiece of venice st

82
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:29,539
mark square now regularly floods more than 60 times a year, which, way back in only happened four times

83
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:40,740
so now, in the 20 st century, venice's ambitious plan to fight back against the ocean and geography is called the mondeosperimentalle or most system

84
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:48,960
essentially, this is a huge system that's designed to hold back the rising tides of the adriatic during high tide in order to better protect the city

85
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
and after multiple delays, it's finally nearly finished

86
00:12:52,879 --> 00:13:05,659
the system consists of several rows of large gates located at each of the three natural inlets, the lead into the venetian lagoon, with the majority of the gates located at the lito inlet, closest to the city of venice itself

87
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:13,120
there are 78 of these gates in total across all three of the inlets, that are each around 20 meters wide, end up to 30 m in length

88
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:22,039
for the deepest sections. under normal tidal conditions, the gates will remain full of water and rest within their respective housing structures down on the sea floor

89
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:35,879
but whenever a high tide coming in from the adriadic is forecasted and the lagoon needs to be defended, the gates will rapidly be drained of water and filled up with comprine so they shoot back up to the surface and then stop the tide from surging into the lagoon

90
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:46,379
and then, once the high tide is over with, the gates will once again be filled up with water and return back down to the sea floor below and allow boats and the natural flow of water above to move about

91
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:57,039
the ultimate goal here is to leave the gates open as much as possible and allow in the natural rhythm between the lagoon and the sea to continue, and to only raise them up when absolutely necessary

92
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,820
but the system has not come without controversy

93
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,360
for one thing, the schedule and cost have been severely overblown when it was initially proposed

94
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,019
most was supposed to be a ten year project and cost billion europe

95
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:27,259
construction began way back in 2003, and it's expected to finally finish only now, at the end of this year, in 2021, more than eight years behind schedule and more than billion euros over budget

96
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:37,820
back in 2014, 35 people, including then mayor of venice, were all arrested by the italian police on corruption charges in connection with the most project

97
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:52,240
multiple environmental groups, including the world wildlife foundation, have repeatedly made negative comments about the project, and while the supporters of most claim that it will be capable of handling the threats of rising sea levels from climate change, many others doubt it

98
00:14:52,399 --> 00:15:03,919
while the gates could always just theoretically be raised to block out rising sea levels, they could only do so by raising the gates so often that they probably just end up functioning more as a near permanent wall

99
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:17,940
by being raised nearly all of the time, the lagoon's natural drainage and interchange with the patriotic sea will be complete destroyed, and the lagoon surrounding venice will inevitably become just a gross, stagnant pool of garbage and algae

100
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,740
unfortunately, though, that may be the only possible solution that exists to save venice

101
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:31,840
it's been estimated before that just a centimeter rise in sea levels will pretty much permanently do venice beneath the waves

102
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,590
and in

103
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:42,039
the famous ipcc report, projected a rise of 600 to eleven hundred centimeters in sea levels by the year 20 100

104
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:54,590
if greenhouse gas emissions remain the very same as they are today, by the end of this century, venice is probably either going to become the 21st century is alantis, or it's going to be stuck inside of a blocked off and

105
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,600
stagnant lagoon that's full of algae and trash

106
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,340
and there doesn't really seem to be many good alternative 3rd choices

107
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:10,580
and throughout all of this, the pace of tourists coming to visit the already drowning and crowded the city isn't seeming to go down either

108
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:28,179
despite the global pandemic, with pent up global demand for international travel at an all time high, the number of tourists who will visit the city in 2025 is projected to soar towards 38 million people, a number that many venetians consider to be grossly unsustainable

109
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:37,919
that would mean, on an average day in there would be nearly one tourist for every two residents in the small, five square kilometer city

110
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:47,220
these extremely high levels of overturism are creating overcrowding and even further environmental problems for the ecosystem around the fragile lagoon

111
00:16:47,440 --> 00:17:05,819
the entire city of venice and its lagoon are considered a the world heritage site by unesco, and because of its rampant over tourism, unesco was considering placing the city on its in danger list, which usually only includes historical ruins in war torn countries like syria or iraq

112
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:17,799
earlier in june of 2021, unesco narrowly avoided placing venice because the italian government finally banned the passage of large cruise ships entering in through the city's historic center

113
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,160
but that's pretty much just a minor step in solving venice's tremendous problems

114
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:34,119
in the end, all of the engineering and policies in the world may not be enough to match the overwhelming, fund higher power than nature is bringing to venice this century

115
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:44,380
i think that ultimately, save for taking venice and pushing it somewhere else, i'm not really certain about venice's future, and neither is anybody else

116
00:17:44,380 --> 00:18:01,029
because in the end, no amount of technology can possibly overcome the fact that venice is located on a chain of sinking islands in the middle of a marshy lagoon, while the water besieging it from the outside is getting higher and higher all the time
