1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,900
california's america's largest, most influential and most powerful states

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,240
with the population near 40 million people

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,199
there are more people living in california than in the entirety of canada

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:23,230
and with a total economy size of trillion, california alone would be the world's 5th largest economy, ahead of even the gigantic india, with 35 times the population

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,629
the two largest engines inside of california

6
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:40,929
that fuel all of this economic and population success are greater los angeles, in the south, america's 2nd largest urban area, home to approximately 13 million people, and the san francisco bay area, further to the north, home to approximately eight million more

7
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:49,810
these are california's two greatest centers of population and financial power, but traveling between both of them has always been a bit of an ordeal

8
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,869
more than 380 mi away from each other, about the same distance as london is from dundee scotland

9
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:05,349
a typical drive between los angeles and san francisco takes at least 6 h to complete, if not even more, depending on the state of traffic

10
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:14,730
the only other real alternative choice available is to visit an airport pastor security, board a plane and fly the roughly hour and a half journey between them in the sky

11
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,209
today, so many people choose this alternative that it has become the 2nd busiest flight route over the entire united states

12
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:32,269
not only are these choices time consuming, expensive and annoying to many, but they're also not exactly ideal for meeting california's increasingly stringent emissions targets

13
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:46,530
and that's why, beginning back in the late 1990s, the state of california began seriously looking into the feasibility of adding in a better, more sensible 3rd option between the cities, high speed rail, which would be a 1st for the united states

14
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,829
on paper, the concept would make an enormous amount of sense for the states

15
00:01:50,989 --> 00:02:03,629
it would provide significantly quicker transportation between the two big cities than driving, and was supposed to be a cheaper alternative to flying, and with numerous stops along the way that would better connect and serve even more of california's population

16
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:13,849
the benefits of rapid transit between centers of commerce would be more accessible to more people than ever within the state, with profound economic benefits

17
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:21,870
and with more people opting to take the train, over flying or driving, california could also work to cut down on their overalls state wide emissions as well

18
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,469
the proposal to begin construction on the rail was passed by california voters 14 years ago, back in 2008

19
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:31,750
but the trouble ever since then has been that the project is grinding
