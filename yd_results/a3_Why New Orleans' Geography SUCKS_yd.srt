1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
this is the united states. this is louisiana, and this is new orleans

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,400
and without constant human intervention, this city literally wouldn't exist

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:19,079
it has perhaps the worst geographic location of any major city in america, and there are countless reasons why that are all named water

4
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:24,109
new orleans, the city that is almost completely surrounded by water on all sides

5
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,030
to the north is lake poncho train

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,030
in the center is the mississippi river

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,189
into the south and east is the ever encroaching seawater from the gulf of mexico

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:46,549
to make matters even worse, 65 % of the new orleans metropolitan area is located either ats or far beneath sea level, a greater percentage than even the netherlands, which is only about a 3rd beneath sea level

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:54,469
this means that when you take a look in new orleans from the side, it's effectively just a big bowl that's surrounded on nearly all of its edges by water

10
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,090
and whenever the water tips over the sides from either the river or the lake, the city drown

11
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:14,049
and to make matters even more severe, new orleans is placement directly at the gulf of mexico's edge makes it the most frequent target of hurricanes in america, with an 11 % risk of being slammed by one every single year

12
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,069
hurricanes make the flooding problem in the city even worse

13
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,370
but that's still not all due to a variety media reasons that i'll get into later in the video

14
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,230
louisiana's coastline has been losing the war against the water for the greater part of a century

15
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,950
now, over the past hundred years, 2000 sq mi

16
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:36,829
of land has been conquered by the ocean in louisiana, south that's twice the size of luxemberg

17
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:48,409
and the ocean's advances are accelerating to the tune of about one football field worth of land every hour, 24 h a day, 365 days a year

18
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:55,909
this is putting the ocean and its waters dangerously closer and closer to new orleans every single hour

19
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:58,609
and it's placing the city on a time bomb

20
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:11,639
southern louisiana is slowly drowning. and it ultimately begs the question, since nature seems to think that settling a city here was such an obviously terrible idea, then why didn't humans

21
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,439
the answer to that is because, of course, it never really seemed like a bad location until fairly recently

22
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:30,409
in fact, for most of americas and even humanity's history, the area around new orleans was without a doubt one of the most important locations on the entire planet to control

23
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,069
take a look at the map of the world

24
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:49,930
pretend that you've just begun a game of civilization, where you're low in the tech tree, and look at where the best locations to build a wealth city are going to be on the north american continent, i would argue, for the area around new orleans being historically the number one pick for one incredibly important reason

25
00:02:50,090 --> 00:03:05,650
despite all the risks of flooding and natural disasters, new orleans sits near the mouth of the mississippi river, and by setting up a choke point here, one can fully control all of the trade in transportation flowing into and out of it

26
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:15,469
this is vital, because by entering the mississippi here, you can travel throughout almost the entirety of the north american interior by way of the mississippi river basin

27
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:24,430
every single one of these creeks streams, rivers, eventually all flow into the mississippi and find their way down to new orleans and the ocean

28
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:35,930
until the advent of modern technology, like railroads, planes or highways, it was rivers and waterways all across the world which served as humanity's high speed transportation and trade arteries

29
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,199
and the mississippi is the biggest and the most important system of them all, anywhere on the planet

30
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:52,439
in fact, the greater mississippi river basin has more kilometers of navigable internal waterways than the entire rest of the world all combined

31
00:03:52,599 --> 00:04:00,939
has this fact is enormous because it was basically the world's largest natural transportation system on any continent

32
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:06,360
that today flows through 31 u-s states and two canadian provinces

33
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:15,819
this system literally connected almost the entire north american continental mainland to the atlantic ocean and the rest of the world from there

34
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:23,939
and all of it could effectively be dominated by whoever controlled just this small show point right near the entrance to the mississippi river

35
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:45,509
the french were the 1st big empire who recognized this area's immense strategic value, and a little over 300 years ago, they founded the small settlement of new orleans here along the rivers curve, where it created a natural levy about one and a half meters above sea level, comparatively higher than the surrounding swamplands that were beneath sea level

36
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:56,449
the initial small settlement fared well against floods and hurricanes, and a century later, found itself under the possession of a new and future global empire the united states

37
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:04,990
the mississippi river and all of its various tributary stretching as far as denver, minneapolis to moine omaha, kansas city in oklahoma city, enabled

38
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:09,410
millions of american settlers to venture out and conquer the west

39
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:17,149
and they could reach all of these places via new orleans, and all of the goods they would end up producing would flow back to new orleans

40
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,990
as america expanded westwards, the mississippi river became roughly the device line between east and west within the continental

41
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,389
states, and the importance of new orleans became ever more apparen't

42
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:44,490
if any enemy power were to gain control of it, they could shut the entire river down and effectively cut america in half and block all of the massive volume of trade flowing down it from the dozens of other states that were making new from new orleans one of the wealthiest cities in the world

43
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:51,870
in fact, by the 1840s, new orleans was america's 3rd biggest city, behind only new york in baltimore

44
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:57,709
and by the time of the civil war, it was easily the south's largest and most important city

45
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:07,470
river boats and barges easily transported luxury goods like cotton from southern states like mississippi, and industrial goods from northern factories up in illinois, indiana and ohio

46
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:11,870
and new orleans was at the zenith of her power and influence

47
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,050
but after the civil war, the city's fortunes were dramatically reverse

48
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:24,689
the invention of new technologies like the railroad introduced new transportation and trade routes that largely bypass new orleans' location down in the southeast

49
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:37,279
as more and more railroads, and later interstate highways for trucks and cars and airports for planes were built, the crucial importance of the mississippi and its various riverways diminished by the 20th century

50
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:46,959
the mississippi no longer had a monopoly on middle america's transportation and trade, and in new orleans's monopoly over a minutes to that system no longer mattered quite as much

51
00:06:47,120 --> 00:07:09,540
by world war two, new orleans had plummeted from america's 3rd largest city to only her 15th, and despite reaching the height of her popular in 1960 with about 620000 people, she was no longer even the biggest city in the american south, with cities like dallas and houston having passed her up with their much more rapid growth

52
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,560
thereafter, new orleans would enter into a slow and steady decline with economic opportunity

53
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,819
moving on to other parts of the country, new orleans lost 18 % of her population in only 30 years

54
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:35,139
between 19 72000. faced with a serious demographic crisis like this, the leaders of the city at the time decided that they needed to encourage more growth by developing more land

55
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:50,040
but the problem with that is that new orleans was founded as an 18th century outpost, and its expansion from those borders into a modern, sprawling city was always doomed to be severely limited by simple geography

56
00:07:50,199 --> 00:08:07,360
as new orleans developed around her colonial era core that was on some of the highest ground available in the area, she had no other choice but to expand further into the swampy and flood prone lands that were closer to in eventually even beneath sea level, which was a dangerous decision

57
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:17,660
in order to develop the swamp land even further, the city began draining out all of the water, which caused the soil beneath to compact and led to the modern city above sinking

58
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,160
today, parts of new orleans are sinking by as much as 5 cm a year

59
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:34,139
and when you remember that most of the city is already beneath sea level and right next to several major bodies of water, you can understand why this is all catastrophically dangerous

60
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:50,279
what makes matters even worse is the fact that sea levels are only rising as time goes on, which is making the bowl shape of new orleans, surrounded by precarious water on all sides, more and more dangerous as the st century continues

61
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,820
with all of that in mind, let's analyze all of new orleans' contemporary geographic issues

62
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,639
1st up lake ponter train. i want you to look at this map of the elevation levels throughout new orleans

63
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:09,379
and now i want you to look at this map that shows the areas with the most severe flooding from hurricane katrina in 2005

64
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:16,980
these really are different maps, but they look almost identical, and the correlation is plain to see

65
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:26,080
when katrina struck its powerful winds, rapidly shoved water from the gulf of mexico into lake poncho train and overflowed it

66
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,539
the levies that were designed to contain it were not built up to standards high enough to overcome this, and many failed

67
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,490
as a result, the water spilled into the bowl that is new orleans, and the city was devastated

68
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,350
over 18 hundred lives were lost

69
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:48,409
over a hundred and $50 billion in damage was caused

70
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:59,600
and because of the mass exodus of refugees escaping all of the chaos, the city's population was reduced by more than half of what it had been before

71
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:07,480
the year after katrina in 2006, new orleans had been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self

72
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:18,019
it was then only the 94th largest city in america, and it was the lowest population the city had ever had since the 18 seventys

73
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,070
over the years since, new orleans has managed to

74
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,830
admirably rebuild, but

75
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:30,909
her population has still, to this day, not ever managed to recover beyond her pre katrina 200

76
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,470
population. it was a catastrophic blow

77
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,200
but hurricanes in the lake are but one of the the many problems that the city is facing

78
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,070
the next is

79
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:48,080
the mississippi river itself. over thousands of years, the mississippi's path has constantly wandered across the landscape of louisiana

80
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:58,240
the mississippi as we know it today has basically only existed since the middle ages, and when the french settled the city in the 18th century, they weren't exactly aware of that

81
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:03,539
beginning around 1900, the mississippi's natural wandering course began to change again

82
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:16,049
had it been left to its own devices, without any human intervention, the mississippi would have by now shifted its primary path over here to the achafalia river, and what remained of the river through new orleans would have effectively just become a stream

83
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:25,669
in comparison, this would have destroyed new orleans's drinking water supply and rendered her strategic location at the mouth of the mississippi pretty much obsolete

84
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:32,009
so rationalizing that it would have been pretty expensive to pretty much abandon the city and push everybody over to the asha feli

85
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:43,549
the river engineers decided instead to construct a massive series of river control structures further up the river to guarantee that the water would continue flowing into the mississippi as we know it today

86
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:54,289
however, some geologists believe that if a future flood is catastrophic enough, the system could be overwhelmed, and the mississippi will find its way over to the feliah and around new orleans anyway

87
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:01,009
and the mississippi poses much more threats to new orleans than simply diverting itself around it like lake poncho train

88
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:11,230
the mississippi also likes to flood a lot, and is higher up than a significant amount of new orleans, so our official levies were constructed along its banks to try and contain it

89
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,350
however, this also had a lot of unintended consequences

90
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:19,389
chief among them was the destruction of louisiana's coastline

91
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:25,009
you see that the mississippi river is chalk full of sediment, which is why the river always looked so brown

92
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:34,070
but over thousands of years, the river continuously deposited these sediments into the gulf of mexico, and compounding over time, created newer and newer marshlands

93
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:41,049
immediately before the european discovery of america, this is roughly what the louisiana coast line naturally looked like

94
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:57,450
but after new orleans was established and the levies were constructed along the rivers banks throughout the 19th century, the sediment rich water could no longer reach and replenish any of these are wetlands, and when combined with rising sea in a myriad of other man made causes, they began to rapidly shrink

95
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:05,629
in the past hundred years alone, louisiana has lost thousands of square miles to the ocean, and it's getting even worse all the time

96
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:18,710
since new orleans itself is sinking by about 5 cm a year, and sea levels are rising by about before millimeters a year, the water is creeping faster and closer to the new orleans bowl all the time

97
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:30,870
over the next 30 years, by 2050, louisiana is projected to lose about another 50 800 km² of wetlands, and the ocean itself will be pretty much on new orleans' doorstep

98
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:41,980
at this point, new orleans will be even more surrounded by water than she is today on all sides, which will only increase the odds of catastrophic floods in the future

99
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:49,480
historically, louisiana's wetlands have provided some kind of barrier of defense between new orleans and hurricanes rampaging in from the gulf

100
00:13:49,639 --> 00:14:00,919
but in the future, without, new orleans will increasingly experience more and more direct impacts from hurricanes that right now have an percent chance of hitting every single year

101
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:31,779
but because of climate change, hurricanes are happening more and more frequently, so the odds of another big one hitting new orleans are only going up, while at the same time, her defenses are growing weaker and weaker with geography abandoning her new orleans has been forced to result more and more, to higher numbers of man made defenses to overcome her now exposed in poor location, like higher and stronger levies, floodgates, pumping stations, river controls and dredging up new artificial land to replace their natural wet defenses

102
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:55,000
but the really big problem that new orleans is going to have to overcome is that rising sea levels and flood risks are not a unique problem faced by them alone, but by dozens of other cities across the united states as well, such as new york, miami and others, who, because they all have bigger populations and economies, will probably be priority targets for any kind of federal flood protection funding

103
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:12,860
so in the end, louisiana itself is one of the most impoverished states in the united states, and without a lot of external federal funding, any man made structures they build still just might not end up being enough compared with the overwhelming firepower than nature is bringing to the table

104
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:22,100
say, for taking new orleans and pushing it somewhere else, like near the asha fallaya, where the mississippi is bound to probably just end up anyway, sometime in the next thousand years

105
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,909
i'm unsure of new orleans' future and how long the city has left

106
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:31,029
which is a tragedy, because i love new orleans

107
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,309
but ultimately, in the end, there isn't any amount of technology that can

108
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,629
overcome the simple fact that new orleans is technically located within a bowl that's surrounded

109
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:48,259
by water, that's getting deeper and deeper and even more surrounded by water with every passing hour

110
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,620
new orleans's future is sadly not certain

111
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:59,220
a couple weeks ago, louisiana fell victim to its 2nd most destructive hurricane on record, behind katrina

112
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,460
while the total cost of the damage has not yet been accurately calculated, it will certainly be an excess of $50 billion

113
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:14,340
the storm's devastation left over a million people across louisiana without power and brought widespread flooding throughout the state

114
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,440
and yet the levies of new orleans held firm in their defense

115
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:25,799
a lot of what's happening today is based on what happened yesterday, last week, last year, or even last decade and beyond

116
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:36,960
with a lot of family around the gulf coast and new orleans, and as someone with knowledge of new orleans' history and geography, the events of hurricane ida had me worried and concerned for days

117
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,779
but information on what exactly was happening was hard to come by

118
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,279
in the storms immediate aftermath, i wanted to understand what was happening in new orleans

119
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,019
that's dear to my heart, but not a place i currently live in

120
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:57,720
and so i began keeping up with the events by reading the frequent short articles that were being posted to morning brew every morning

121
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,740
this is what i love the most about using morning brew
