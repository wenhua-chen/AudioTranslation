1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,299
In 2001, the United States military invaded Afghanistan

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,459
20 years later, the U-S is withdrawing

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:12,019
and the Taliban appears to be stronger than ever, with control of up to 85 % of the country

4
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,500
In 1979, the Soviet Union also invaded Afghanistan

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,010
and after nine years, they also withdrew The regime they fought so hard to prop up

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,850
almost immediately collapsed

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,250
And before them

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:32,450
the British Empire invaded Afghanistan on three separate occasions and failed to conquer them in each instance

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,310
Today, afghanistan has a smaller population than California

10
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,070
in a territory that's only a little larger than France

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:48,030
So how is it that a country of this small size was capable of resisting three of the world's most powerful military juggernauts from history

12
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,659
There's a lot of answers to that question

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,579
but let's start with the easiest to understand

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,420
and perhaps the most obvious geography

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,729
In reality, afghanistan is little more than a geographical expression

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,849
All of her borders were arbitrarily drawn up by outside foreign powers more than a century ago

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:13,150
Its small population is composed of a loose association of 14 different ethno linguistic groups and numerous more tribes

18
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:14,349
many of which

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,310
like the Uzbeks to g Greeks and Pashtons, straddle the country's borders

20
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,430
artificial boundaries set up by Westerners hundreds of years ago that mean very little to them

21
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,150
The Peshtons make up nearly half of afghanistan's population a day

22
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,069
but two thirds of all Pashtons live next door in neighboring Pakistan

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,030
and are a minority group there

24
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:41,709
The border between Afghanistan and Pakistan runs directly through the Pashton tribal area and divides the 60 million Pashton people between both countries

25
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,629
This boundary was artificially dissent by the British Empire back in 1893

26
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,709
and to date, not a single government based in Afghanistan has ever officially ratified it

27
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,549
Imagine if in Europe, poland was divided between Germany and Russia

28
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,989
and a wall was built directly between both sides of where the Poles live

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,590
Obviously

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,629
the Poles would never recognize this border and routinely cross it visit family and friends

31
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,930
And the pastones largely treat the Afghan Pakistan border the very same way

32
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,509
The border here is extremely mountainous and rural

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,310
so patrolling it from the Pakistani government's perspective has always been quite challenging

34
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:26,889
This has allowed pastun insurgents operating with an Afghanistan the valuable ability to easily escape across the border into the friendly pastun areas of Pakistan

35
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,610
regroup and recover, recruit more men and then travel back into Afghanistan

36
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,210
freshly supplied and ready for more combat

37
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:38,189
Neither the Afghan border nor the Taliban recognize this border as legitimate

38
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:45,189
and there are at least 235 known crossing points across the border and through the mountains between both countries

39
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,150
Militants, drugs, money and supplies can easily be smuggled into Afghanistan by way of Pakistan

40
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:57,990
And it's made all the easier by many of the pastones of Pakistan being more sympathetic to the Afghan or Taliban cause

41
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:05,389
This has led many people to label the Afghan Pakistan border as the most dangerous border in the entire world

42
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,060
And recently, as a result of all of this, by the end of June

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,539
pakistan has finally finished building a fence across the entire length of the border

44
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,740
specifically to stop all of this

45
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,219
and has restricted border crossings to only legally designated locations

46
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:27,539
But this is all only the start of what makes Afghanistan an almost most impossible place to conquer

47
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,740
I mean, just look at the map

48
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:37,780
Afghanistan is a landlocked so getting your troops and supplies there requires the cooperation of at least one of the six countries that borders it

49
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:42,860
iran, turkmenistan, uzbekistan, tajikistan, china and of course, pakistan

50
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,620
But even once you get across one of the countries and you arrive at afghanistan's borders

51
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,939
you're going to be met with afghanistan's mon you mentally challenging terrain

52
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,830
Despite being in the center of the world's most populous continent

53
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:00,710
afghanistan has always been heavily isolated and largely rural and underpopulated

54
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,990
Because of this

55
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:09,710
the high peaks of the Hindu kush Mountain range was some of the tallest and biggest mountains found anywhere on the planet

56
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:14,030
75 % of Afghanistan territories consider to be mountainous

57
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,670
and nearly half of our territory has an elevation above 2000 m

58
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,870
which makes Afghanistan among the most mountainous countries of the world

59
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,870
and among the most isolated too

60
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,629
As a result, these huge mountains act like natural walls in more ways than one

61
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,170
They help to keep invaders out

62
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,769
but they also separate communities within and make transporting supplies across challenging

63
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,750
These are all very difficult factors to overcome from the perspective of any outside invader

64
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,689
There are dozens of valleys that zigzag in between the mountains of Afghanistan

65
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,610
where most of the population resides

66
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,889
and since they're surrounded by some of the biggest and most formidable mountains on Earth

67
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,569
it's always been difficult to travel between them

68
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,529
And consequently, they're each sort of their own little world in sight of Afghanistan

69
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,490
Over thousands of years, each ended up developing their own rather distinctive cultures

70
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,490
identities, beliefs, tribes and rulers

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,009
and thus there's very little sense of Afghan nationhood

72
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:22,050
And Afghan patriotism has never been a particularly strong motivating factor because of all these separate and rural communities that are difficult to travel between

73
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,050
The grip of any government has always been weak and intermittent

74
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:31,810
while the valleys have largely governed themselves autonomously, especially in the countryside

75
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:41,310
Any semblance of Afghan national unity has always been a direct consequence of foreign powers invading and attempting to impose their rule over the whole

76
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:47,129
Like with the British Soviets in recently, americans, historically, end up to the present day

77
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,750
To an extent

78
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:55,069
afghanistan continues to operate in a way that's more similar to the Holy Roman Empire than the European Union

79
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,310
The ruler in the capital city, kabul may nominally wheel desure authority over the entire realm

80
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:02,790
like the Holy Roman emperor

81
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:07,350
but is not able to wheel defecto authority over all of the various princes

82
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,550
valleys, tribes and clans

83
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,550
Just like the Holy Roman

84
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:18,509
any invader coming into occupy Afghanistan will struggle with all of the same issues that a domestic ruler

85
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:23,490
Well, afghanistans Geography is not very conducive to a centralized authority

86
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,490
and neither is afghanistan's infrastructure

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:40,399
Enforcing your authority across the various Afghan valleys means that you must move your troops and supplies from one to another through the various mountain passes that are often narrow and incredibly easy positions to set up an ambush in as a defender

88
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,220
These passes basically act like natural choke points for the movement of people all across Afghanistan

89
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:51,720
And up until the 1960s, there were hardly even any roads to speak of that went through them

90
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:57,439
Control over just a few of these mountain passes can ensure control over an entire valley

91
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,439
and sabotaging one can block the flow of supplies and troops for days

92
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,040
weeks or even longer, depending upon the severity of the damage

93
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,120
Soviets invaded the country

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,759
the Mujahadin defenders would ambush Soviet convoys as they traveled through these passes

95
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,600
and then immediately flee back and vanish into the caves of the mountains

96
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,040
When they were fired back upon, they would set up road blocks at river crossings or in other passes

97
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,759
and in some instances, were successful enough to block entire roads for months or even years

98
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,600
The town of Coast

99
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,600
near the Pakistan border was permanently sealed off from the rest of the country for the entire war by the muj Adine

100
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,399
sabotaging a series of strategic roads

101
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,920
and the government forces blocked inside could only be supplied by air

102
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,480
And when the Americans invaded, these passes were just as vital

103
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,519
so significant for them was the Cyber pass here

104
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,800
the easiest and most direct path through the Hindu cush between the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia

105
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:01,279
This path has been used for thousands of years by conquerors, traders and missionaries all alike

106
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,480
and is without a doubt one of the most strategic locations to hold on the entire planet

107
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,720
At one point

108
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,680
nearly 80 % of all NATO and U-S supplies that were being brought into Afghanistan by road

109
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,040
We're all coming through the Cyber Pass via Pakistan

110
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,079
which is kind of ironic

111
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,319
because most of the Taliban s equipment were also coming from across the border in Pakistan

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
just at different and more rural crossing point

113
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,959
The Taliban knew how critically important the Kyber Pass was to the American war effort

114
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,840
so it was a frequent target of sabotage efforts

115
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,960
In 2009, the Taliban blew up a bridge here, the temporarily shut down the entire pass

116
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,600
and America was forced to broaden their supply lines into Afghanistan through the three central Asian bordering countries as well

117
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:47,750
In the years before all of this war

118
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:53,470
the Afghan government had attempted a build of circular highway that would connect all of their major economic centers together

119
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:58,870
But over the decades of civil war and Soviet intervention, the highway was in very bad shape

120
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:01,309
By the time the United States invaded in 2001

121
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:07,950
there were only a mere 50 km of paved roads to speak of in the entire country

122
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,309
That's bigger than France

123
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,789
For comparison

124
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:18,110
france has million kilometers of paved roads in a smaller and significantly less mountainous territory

125
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:25,429
The lack of good roads only made the disparate valleys and communities of the Afghan interior even more isolated from each other

126
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:32,110
and may transporting troops and supplies a logistical nightmare for the Americans and the Soviets before them

127
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,070
none of which helped at all for the countrys stability

128
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:37,110
As with all things in Afghanistan

129
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,909
the development of new roads is difficult and expensive because of the harsh

130
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,830
mountainous terrain

131
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,230
the cold winter weather that often choose roads up and sabotage from the Taliban and other insurgents

132
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:54,470
Building a repairing roads in the country necessitates hiring security and necessitates building them across harsh geography and climates

133
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:01,549
which means that it can get incredibly expensive, as much as $5 million per mile in some locations

134
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,950
And this is all in a country where the average person only makes a little over over $500 a year

135
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,549
one of the poorest and least developed nations on the planet

136
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:20,629
The construction of a single mile of road within Afghanistan is about the combined annual wages of 90 800 Afghanis

137
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:26,070
So obviously the funding for all of these projects has to come from abroad

138
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,909
Ultimately, afghanistan is easy to invade and take over

139
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:32,629
but it's almost impossible to effectively hold it for long

140
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,299
The landscape is huge, with a lot of rural and empty places for insurgents and rebels to hide

141
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,940
Getting troops in and establishing supply lines through massive mountains and narrow passes is challenging

142
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,820
An easy for guerrilla combatants to harass and disrupt

143
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,779
The relationship with neighboring Pakistan is complex

144
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,220
and peshton insurgents can easily cross the border, regroup without much fear

145
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,179
and then return to fight in Afghanistan whenever ready

146
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,860
The flow of insurgent supplies

147
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,419
money and manpower across the border is difficult to stop through the hundreds of high and remote mountain passes

148
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:07,740
and requires the cooperation of Pakistan

149
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,059
which she is sometimes willing to give

150
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,580
and other times not

151
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,429
Centralized rule is almost impossible to enforce outside of Kabul

152
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,029
by way of afghanistan's geographic reality

153
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,269
And a nation building is inherently impossible, because even the concept of an Afghan nation

154
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,590
among afghanistan's various ethnicities and tribes, is tenuous at best

155
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,389
and certainly radically different from the Western idea of nation state such as Germany or France

156
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,750
The colonial era borders of Afghanistan, dictated by the British over a century ago

157
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,230
are probably the biggest core reason for afghanistan's instability

158
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:48,970
But Afghanistan has been particularly unstable, even by former British colonial medaling standards

159
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:55,070
For the past 43 years, afghanistan, pakistan, has been embroiled in constant warfare

160
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:58,149
and it's an incredibly complex story to tell

161
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:08,309
From a communist revolution that enforced state atheism in one of the most conservative and religious countries on the planet to an invasion and occupation by the Soviet Union

162
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,269
three subsequent civil wars

163
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,669
and then the invasion of the American Africans and NATO and the United States occupation

164
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:19,490
That's all set to finally end after nearly 20 years, in about a month from now

165
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,230
It is one of the most fascinating

166
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,429
violent and controversial conflicts of both the 20th and 21st centuries

167
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:31,629
and unfortunately not acceptable for me to cover on Youtube due to their terms of service

168
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,240
I know how making videos on Youtube works

169
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,799
and I know that this video already has a super high chance of being demonitized and unpromoted by youtube's algorithm because of what I'm discussing

170
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,080
But the moment that I really start diving into the whole history of the Afghan conflicts

171
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,159
why they began, how they were fought

172
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,279
and how it all led to where we are today

173
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,080
It's a guarantee that this video will be censored

174
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,720
and you won't get to see it

175
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,840
So instead

176
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,799
I created another full length companion video to this one with all of that controversial but fascinating information included

177
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,879
and uploaded that version to Nebula, which, as you've probably heard by now

178
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,279
is home to tons of exclusive, ad free content, like my entire modern conflict series

179
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,600
with additional full length videos you can go watch right now

180
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,360
detailing the Israel Palestine conflicts, the 2020 Armenia Azerbaijan war

181
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,960
and the ongoing russo Ukraine war in the don Bass

182
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:25,720
Of course

183
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:34,919
the reason why all of these videos are only on Nebula is because the youtube algorithm actually punishes me and all other creators forever trying anything new

184
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,320
But Nebula is a different platform without an algorithm and without ads

185
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,960
It's just a platform about great and unique content made by great and independent educational creators

186
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:53,019
Nebula's ecosystem enables us to take big risks with expensive projects like america's big ghost Town

187
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:57,279
My own 35 minute long documentary shot on location around the Sultan Sea

188
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,840
the largest lake in California

189
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,320
and arguably america's greatest environmental disaster

190
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,679
that drove thousands from their homes

191
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,519
and as a result, created america's largest ghost town

192
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,940
and plenty of other projects for more creators you probably know

193
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,179
like whenover productions half as interesting, tom Scott and many others

194
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,500
The best way to get access to Nebula and all of this incredible content is definitely through the amazing Curiosity Stream

195
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,500
Nebula bundle deal

196
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,059
With its current sales price, it's less than $15 a year to get access to both sites

197
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,340
And curiositys Stream has some phenomenal stuff too, like Afghanistan 1979, a 57 minute long

198
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:46,659
fantastic documentary that dives deep into the entire course of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent war in amazing detail

199
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,340
If you felt like my video didn't go into and this is the video for you

200
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,259
And it includes actual interviews with surviving veterans of the war from both the Afghan and Soviet perspectives alike

201
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,220
including Mikhail Gorbachev, with enormous amounts of historical footage and context

202
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,820
I really can't recommend this documentary enough

203
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,659
and I genuinely don't know about a better deal to exist in streaming

204
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,500
You get to streaming sites

205
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,059
both with content you'll actually watch and all for less than $15 a year at the current sales price

206
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,059
