1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
More energy will fall on the world's deserts in 6 h than the entire world will consume over the next year

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,220
The Sahara Desert is well known for being the world's largest hot desert

3
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,660
but it's probably a lot bigger than you even realize

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,440
It's nearly the same size as China

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,410
It spans across ten different countries in three different time zones

6
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:23,769
and it gets absolutely massacred by sunlight

7
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,289
This is a map that shows annual sunshine hours across the world

8
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:31,089
There are some notable hot spots in North America, south America and Southern Africa

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,670
But nowhere gets as much as the Sahara Desert

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,850
Most of this China size chunk of land gets more than 30 600 h of sunlight a year

11
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,649
Within that big chunk is this other chunk that gets more than 4000 h a year

12
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:49,929
For reference, that's nearly four times the amount of annual sunlight the Germany gets

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,880
Most of this is because the Sahara Desert is a pretty much directly along the tropic of Cancer

14
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,799
which means the sun, for a lot of the year, is pretty much directly over it

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,840
and b clouds pretty much never form or even exist over the entire desert

16
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,400
which means all that sunlight is never interrupted

17
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,140
The Sahara, consequently

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,459
is the best location anywhere on Earth to play solar panels and develop solar farms

19
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:17,790
So it then begs the question, what if we covered the entire desert with solar panels

20
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:19,709
How much energy would we actually be able to produce

21
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:21,590
and how would this change our planet

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,469
Let's take a deep dive for starters

23
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:24,969
Let's begin here

24
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,409
This is the wears as that solar power station in Morocco

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,530
the world's largest concentrated solar power plant currently in existence in a marvel of modern engineering

26
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:43,609
Once fully completed an operational the plant will take up an area of 25 kmÂ² and be capable of producing 500 to megawatts of electricity

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,370
It will even be capable of storing solar energy in the form of superheated molten salt

28
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,090
which allows for further production of electricity even into the night

29
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:56,569
After investing more than $9 billion into their solar energy objective

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,209
morocco aims to create four additional plants similar to this one in the Sahara

31
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,129
that will collectively create more than 2000 mw of electricity production

32
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:12,090
which will be enough to provide for roughly percent of all of morocco's annual electricity needs

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,530
This project will transform Morocco into the world's leading solar energy state

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,810
and as the only African country that currently has a power cable link to Europe

35
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,650
much of this energy will be exported for profit to the countries of the European Union

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,159
But all of this energy is created from just five relatively small plants

37
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:35,719
What happens when we scale things up a bit and think bigger

38
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:41,930
One of the few organizations thinking about Sahara solar energy production in the future is the German energy company

39
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:42,650
desert Attack

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,099
which happens to be an investor of the Moroccan solar energy project

41
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,219
According to their research and data taken from the German Aerospace Center

42
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:59,069
a solar panel array of just this small size in the Sahara could power 100 % of germany's entire electricity needs

43
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,750
An array of this size could power the entire European Union

44
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:07,909
while an array of just this size could power the entire world's modern electricity needs

45
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:11,830
at approximately 18 trillion watts, give or take a bit

46
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,870
considering that a typical solar panel generates roughly 350 watts of power

47
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:22,710
this earth powering array would encompass around 51.4 billion solar panels

48
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,349
and it would be roughly the same size as the U-S state of New Mexico, quite a large amount of land

49
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:36,110
but it's nothing when compared with the vastness of the then also happens to be incredibly sparsely populated

50
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,789
Only about two and a half million people live across the Sahara

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,319
which means that its population density is on a par with Siberia

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,439
which further means that it's possible to set up huge solar farms like this without too much of a negative impact on the local inhabitants

53
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,919
The Desert Tech Project doesn't quite intend on transforming the entire Saharan to a solar farm

54
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,599
but it's still quite ambitious

55
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,960
The general idea to set up a series of massive solar farms across the sahara's perimeter and deeper into the Middle East

56
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:07,199
Once constructed

57
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,560
this collection of solar farms will provide for the majority of Africas and the Middle East electricity needs

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,960
while shipping any excess power across cables to Europe

59
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,439
that could supply as much as 15 % of the continents in higher electricity needs

60
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,600
This is a real life plan that's undergone significant amounts of research and investment

61
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,600
But why are they only planning on building solar farms around the sahara's perimeter

62
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:31,839
Well

63
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,899
while there's lots of obvious benefits to constructing solar farms in the empty Sahara

64
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,939
there's also lots of problems

65
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,980
1st of all, the sahara's emptiness itself is both a blessing and a curse

66
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,139
On the one hand, it means that almost nobody will have to be relocated or moved off of their land

67
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,339
but on the other hand

68
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:55,060
there isn't any infrastructure to actually get the map massive amounts of supplies into place in any kind of cost effective manner

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
I mean, look at this map

70
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,620
There's only like four roads that even stretch across the Sahara from the north to the south

71
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,540
There are huge empty pockets of land across the desert without a single road at all

72
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,899
And some of these areas, like this northwestern pocket of Chad

73
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,860
are more than 600 km kilometers away from the nearest road

74
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:19,579
Transporting billions of solar panels to a remote area like this will necessitate building countless new

75
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,819
expensive highways or railroads to get them there

76
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,279
And that's why Desert Tech is only planning on constructing plants around the Sahara

77
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,620
But let's forget all of that for a moment

78
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,540
and just think about the cost of the solar panels themselves In a This is a Harra sized array

79
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:41,399
A pretty average 350 watt solar panel typically cost anywhere between $250 once fully installed on a residential roof

80
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Today

81
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,740
since we know that it's going to be expensive transporting and installing all of them in the middle of one of the world's most remote locations

82
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:56,300
we're going to stick with the high cost estimate here and attack on an additional $300 are delivery in infrastructure fees and 250 more dollars for installation fees

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,139
Conveniently, this math makes the total cost for each 350 wat panel exactly 1000

84
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,139
So from there

85
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:12,339
you can figure out pretty quickly that the 51.4 billion solar panels needed to fit inside of our new Mexico sized array that will power the entire planet costa cool $51.4 trillion

86
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,420
For reference, that's approximately 60 % of the entire world's GDP

87
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,720
But it would enable us to immediately switch all of our electricity over to renewable solar

88
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,819
So that's pretty cool

89
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,509
All right, then now let's just assume that we've turned on infinite money

90
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:35,069
and we expanded upon this by filling up the entire Sahara Desert with solar panels

91
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,420
What is going to happen now

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,420
Well, for starters, if we assume that the solar panels are 100 % efficient

93
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:50,620
the entire Sahara Desert will probably now be producing somewhere around the neighborhood of million terawatt hours of electricity per year

94
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,420
So to put that number in a perspective

95
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:01,459
the entire contemporary human species consumed about 173000 terawatt hours of energy in 2019

96
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,259
And that's not just electricity

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,540
That's all energy consumed for everything we did that year

98
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:19,069
A Sahara desert covered in solar panels will generate more than seven times the amount of energy that all of the nearly 8 billion humans of the world collectively consume right now

99
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,519
Obviously, this would present revolutionary changes to what mankind could be capable of

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,279
And not just even closer to a type one CARDISHEV style civilization

101
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:37,500
But this overwhelming power given to humanity by harnessing the entire Sahara would also come with some significant costs

102
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,240
The black surfaces of the solar panels dotting the Sahara will of course absorb most of the sunlight hitting the Sahara

103
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,980
Only a tiny fraction of that incoming energy will actually be converted into electricity

104
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,860
while the overwhelming majority will be returned back to the environment as heat

105
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:53,779
In turn

106
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:03,500
this heat will trigger a sort of feedback loop in which the heat amid by the solar panels would create a steep temperature differential between the land and the surrounding oceans

107
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,620
This will ultimately lower the surface air pressure and cause moist air to rise and condens into clouds and rain across the desert

108
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,709
So by covering the entire Sahara with solar panels

109
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:21,990
will also unwittingly be terraforming the desert Sahara into a green Sahara at the same time

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,339
In some ways, this will be good

111
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,220
because it will open up a massive amount of land the size of China to colonization

112
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,299
human settlement, and, critically, for the emerging economies of North Africa

113
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,580
extensive economic development for their countries and their people

114
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,669
But in other ways, this will be really bad

115
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,389
The Amazon rainforest

116
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:46,269
over in South America is extensively fed and fertilized by dust coming over from the Sahara that gets blown across the Atlantic

117
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,870
while the Atlantic ecosystems themselves also benefit from this fertile dust as well

118
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:59,090
Removing all of the sands of the Sahara Desert could create a cascade of unforeseen events that could wipe out entire ecosystems in the Atlantic

119
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,210
the Amazon and probably beyond

120
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,850
and create an epic climate catastrophe, the likes we have never seen before

121
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,820
In summary, covering the entire Sahara with solar panels would be epic

122
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,220
but it's also not feasible

123
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,860
It's probably pretty dangerous

124
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,860
And it's not even necessary either
