1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,379
California's america's largest, most influential and most powerful states

2
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,860
With the population near million people

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,199
There are more people living in California than in the entirety of Canada

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,820
And with a total economy size of trillion

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,859
california alone would be the world's 5th largest economy

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,890
ahead of even the gigantic India, with 35 times the population

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,629
The two largest engines inside of California

8
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,289
That fuel all of this economic and population success are greater Los Angeles

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:35,609
in the South, america's 2nd largest urban area, home to approximately 13 million people

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,409
and the San Francisco Bay Area, further to the north, home to approximately eight million more

11
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,770
These are california's two greatest centers of population and financial power

12
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,289
but traveling between both of them has always been a bit of an ordeal

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,869
More than 380 mi away from each other, about the same distance as London is from Dundee Scotland

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,490
A typical drive between Los Angeles and San Francisco takes at least 6 h to complete

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,969
if not even more, depending on the state of traffic

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,890
The only other real alternative choice available is to visit an airport pastor security

17
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,209
board a plane and fly the roughly hour and a half journey between them in the sky

18
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:14,909
Today

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,689
so many people choose this alternative that it has become the 2nd busiest flight route over the entire United States

20
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,730
Not only are these choices time consuming, expensive and annoying to many

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,890
but they're also not exactly ideal for meeting california's increasingly stringent emissions targets

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,329
And that's why, beginning back in the late 1990s

23
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,329
the state of California began seriously looking into the feasibility of adding in a better

24
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,849
more sensible 3rd option between the cities, high speed rail

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,010
which would be a 1st for the United States

26
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:50,829
On paper, the concept would make an enormous amount of sense for the States

27
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:55,049
It would provide significantly quicker transportation between the two big cities than driving

28
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,689
and was supposed to be a cheaper alternative to flying

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,290
and with numerous stops along the way that would better connect and serve even more of california's population

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:10,770
The benefits of rapid transit between centers of commerce would be more accessible to more people than ever within the state

31
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:13,330
with profound economic benefits

32
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,569
And with more people opting to take the train, over flying or driving

33
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,370
california could also work to cut down on their overalls state wide emissions as well

34
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,050
The proposal to begin construction on the rail was passed by California voters 14 years ago

35
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:26,530
back in 2008

36
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:34,370
But the trouble ever since then has been that the project is grinding along at a pace that is now dramatically over budget

37
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,289
to the tune of tens of billions of dollars and several years behind schedule

38
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,090
So what's been going on

39
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:42,930
Why has California specifically

40
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,250
and America in general, struggled so much with building a legitimate high speed rail line

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,610
while countries of smallest Spain have more than 3000 km of high speed rail lines right now

42
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,919
Let's get into it

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,639
1st of all, let's talk about the facts on the ground within the United States as they exist today

44
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,939
Specifically, there aren't really any high speed rail lines in the country yet

45
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,599
There's technically the Acela Express that's run by AMTRAK across the Northeast

46
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,120
from Washington, D-C to Boston

47
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,919
that features america's fastest train speeds of 150 mph

48
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,719
but only across a small stretch of just 34 mi out of the entire 457 mile routes

49
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:29,479
While most of the high speed part takes place along the 226 mi section between Union station and Washington D-C and Pennsylvania Station in New York City

50
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:30,800
Between these two cities

51
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:38,800
the Acila Express is capable of running passengers in 2 h and four 45 min while averaging a speed of around 82 mi an hour

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
when factoring in the various stops along the way

53
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,919
Well, perhaps not exactly what comes to mind when imagining true high speed rail

54
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,159
like in Japan or Europe

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,840
It still beats driving between DC and New York by over an hour

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,960
and it successfully managed to capture a full 75 % of all the air and trained commuters between the two cities

57
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,400
The Essellist service has proved to be a resounding success for commuter travel in the American Northeast

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,800
and the California High Speed Rail Project is looking to dramatically expand upon that success in the West

59
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:16,120
The overall plan, as proposed back in 2008, was set to be carried out in two distinct phases

60
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,800
Phase one of the plan would aim to link up San Francisco in the north

61
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,120
down to Los Angeles and Anaheim in the south

62
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,519
via the Central Valley, with ten additional stations in between them

63
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,319
Once completed

64
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:41,879
the system would be capable of transporting passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles at speeds of more than 200 mph in a non stop time of just two 2 h and 40 min and at an advertised cost back in 2008 of only $50 a passenger one way

65
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,639
Upon this initial phases, completion

66
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,350
phase two of the line would commence with further extensions, connecting Modesto

67
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,709
stocked in in the state capital of Sacramento, to the system in the north

68
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,389
along with San Bernardino, marietta, as Candido

69
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,269
and ultimately San Diego in the south, as well

70
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,069
fully connecting all of california's most populous cities and regions together by high speed rail

71
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,990
capable of moving people anywhere else in the system within hours

72
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:11,089
But the benefits would extend far beyond simply moving people across the state

73
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,250
Quicker

74
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:11,870
Back in 2009

75
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:27,069
the Rail authority released projections that the system would ultimately create 450000 permanent new jobs across the state through the increased rates of people commuting into major cities further away than they ordinarily would have without the rail

76
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,110
And for a region like the San Walking Valley in particular

77
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,910
the benefits of the rail would almost certainly outweigh anywhere else in the States

78
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,670
Today, this region is the most impoverished part of California

79
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:41,509
and it's unfortunately been that way for a long time

80
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,269
A largely rural area, the valleys Californias

81
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,550
most substantial contributor to the agricultural and oil industries

82
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:51,389
and is only a few densely populated clusters of population

83
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,149
like Fresno, bakersfield, stockton and Merced

84
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:55,009
However

85
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:04,430
six of the counties inside of the valley rank as the top six counties in the whole state of California for the high this percentage of residents living beneath the poverty line

86
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,870
And they rank even among the most impoverished counties across the entire United States

87
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,560
Of the top five poorest metropolitan areas in the entire United States

88
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,879
three of them are here in the Sand Walking Valley

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,939
Nearly one in three children living in the value are impoverished

90
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,740
The median household income is 40 % beneath what it is across the rest of the state

91
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:32,639
And the situation has been constantly evolving since the 1990 as the cost of living in the hugely populated

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,680
geographically nearby urban areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles have skyrocketed

93
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,759
more and more

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,759
young families and small businesses have been given no other choice than to leave

95
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,360
and many of them have settled in the sand Walking Valley

96
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,319
Thus, major cities in the valley, like Stockton, modesto and others

97
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,120
have become increasingly important as commuter cities for working class people into San Francisco

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,759
while Bakersfield has become the same for commuters into Los Angeles

99
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,360
And thus the population and real estate values within the valley have been increasing for decades

100
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,959
but the area's transportation system hasn't been able to keep up with the pace

101
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:15,339
And the Cow California High Speed Royal Project promises to alleviate a lot of these issues in the community here

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,279
Not only will it enable commuters to move more quickly to regions with higher paying jobs

103
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,120
like San Francisco or Los Angeles

104
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,040
but it will also bring with it new jobs and opportunities

105
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,360
and the cities that ultimately receive stations, like Bakersfield, fresno and Mer said

106
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,959
should see increase growth and development prop up around them as well

107
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:32,759
And by 2080

108
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:46,720
the initial projections assumed that the system would reduce auto traffic across all of california's highways and roads to such an extent that it would cut down approximately 400 billion mi worth of vehicle travel within the state

109
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,879
which would have obvious environmental benefits to boost

110
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:50,759
But now

111
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,600
here's the thing All of this was proposed to voters in the state back in 2008 by the California High Speed Rail Authority

112
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,439
an organization that had been set up by the state government twelve years previously, back in 1996

113
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:10,240
Their proposal estimated a total cost of construction for the project at $33 billion and that the 1st trains would begin running by 2020

114
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:17,079
Just Twelve years later, $9 billion of state issued bonds were issued to help fund the project

115
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,319
with the rest of the funding expected to come in from the federal US governments and private investors

116
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:28,759
However, were obviously now in 2022, more than 14 years after the proposition was passed

117
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,000
and two years beyond when service was 1st expected to begin

118
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,399
What's more, the total cost for just the 500 mile long phase one of the system

119
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,960
linking San Francisco to Los Angeles and Anaheim

120
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,440
has ballooned nearly threefold from the original sticker price to at least $105000000000 now

121
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,000
already making it the largest single investment in California history and one of america's most ambitious civil engineering projects ever

122
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,360
And the final price is almost certainly going to be even higher than that

123
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,799
because that estimate is based on some old assumptions back from 2019

124
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,919
like an average inflation rate just 3 %

125
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:15,840
Obviously, with annual inflation rates currently running hot and well over 8 %

126
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,759
a lot of these assumptions are outdated

127
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,559
and the final price tag will almost certainly be higher in the end

128
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:26,120
For context, though, even with the 2019 projections

129
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:33,120
that is still about one 5th the price of the entire U-S interstate highway system

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,559
that expands for a hundred times longer, across nearly 50000 mi

131
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,320
throughout all 50 U-S states and Puerto Rico

132
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,919
and accounts for a quarter of all vehicle miles driven by all 320000000 plus Americans

133
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:56,759
But it's not only the cost that have been dramatically scaled up for the California High Speed Rail since being brought to voters back in 2008

134
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:04,700
Construction on this system ever since has focused on building out to the 170 1 MI center across the central valley

135
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,000
1st there will link baker's Field in the south with Merced in the north

136
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,879
giving commuters the opportunities to transfer firmers said onto the preexisting Altamont Corridor

137
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,120
express and sandwalkings, amtrack rail routes to link to either Sacramento or the Bay Area

138
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,159
and a transfer from baker's Field in the south on amtrax threw way bus service down

139
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:23,879
However

140
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,159
even this initial central segment is currently not projected to be completed until the end of this decade

141
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,279
around 2029

142
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,440
After it's hopefully completed by then

143
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,639
the next major focus will be on completing the extension in the north towards Gilroy and San Jose

144
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,679
which includes the southernmost terminus of the already existing cow train

145
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,019
which will ultimately enable high speed trains to finally run from San Francisco down to baker's Field

146
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:53,720
The full completion of phase one, linking San Francisco to Los Angeles and Anaheim

147
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,279
is now not expected to be finished any time before 2033

148
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,000
with room for even further delays in the future

149
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,440
And that's not even men the eventual planned extensions towards San Diego and Sacramento

150
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,519
which at this rate, nobody even really knows about

151
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:10,639
At the same time

152
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,879
the latest figures for estimated one way ticket prices on the system between San Francisco and Los Angeles are from 2015

153
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:25,159
and were already inflated up to $86 from the 50 initially advertised voters back in 2008

154
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,000
When adjusted to inflation today, in 2022

155
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,120
that $86 estimate from 2015 is really more like a hundred and $5 now

156
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:41,120
which is very often even more expensive than just taking a one way flight between the two cities would be

157
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,399
And there have been numerous

158
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,360
numerous setbacks for the project that have been causing all of these issues

159
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,940
One of the most significant is simply the reality of california's geography

160
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,320
There are three major mountain ranges for the rail to eventually cross through

161
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,840
like the southern coast ranges, transverse ranges and peninsula ranges

162
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,600
that specifically require lengthy and expensive tunnels through active seismic zone

163
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:08,919
And moreover, california has the 2nd highest average real estate prices of any state in the country

164
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:14,000
making the cost of purchasing an acquiring land for the rail to traverse prohibitively expensive

165
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:18,559
The project has struggled with acquiring necessary land ever since its inception

166
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,440
But even now

167
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:29,799
there are still more than 200 parcels of land that the railway needs to acquire in order to capture a 52 mile section in Kings County to finish out the central Beggars Field

168
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,000
tomer said segment

169
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,159
which isn't really good for them, because construction on this route has obviously already begun

170
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,039
and they really need that land at pretty much any price

171
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:44,200
and the people who own the land can sell it for inflated prices

172
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,840
And thus, as of 2014

173
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:55,399
the World Bank reported that the per kilometer price tag of california's high speed rail system was standing at approximately 56 million dollars

174
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,120
which is freakishly higher than in other countries, like China, where it's more like $19 million

175
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,639
or about one 3rd of the price

176
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:03,799
Even in Europe

177
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,399
similar high speed rail projects have only cost between 25 and $39 million per kilometer of track

178
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,419
But the prices in California aren't equal everywhere

179
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,080
Part of the reason why the plan was to build the central segment of the high speed rail 1st across the central valley

180
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,120
in the 1st place, widely heckled as the trained nowhere between bakers Field and Merced

181
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,000
is just because that's simply the cheapest place to actually build out the infrastructure

182
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,309
because the land is pretty much just flat, rural farmland everywhere here

183
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,309
the construction figures are more like 11.4 million /km

184
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:40,870
which is highly comparable to international prices elsewhere like China or Europe

185
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:46,629
It's only when the rail eventually starts getting into the mountains and the seismically active areas further towards Los Angeles

186
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,029
san San Francisco that the price is truly explode exponentially

187
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,750
and that that's leading a lot of people concerned

188
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:01,590
because the expected funding that was advertised back in 2008 has also been hard to actually come by in the decade plus since

189
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:06,549
with construction costs going up and the subsequent cost and ticket prices going up alongside of them

190
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:13,509
the rails competitiveness with airlines between San Francisco and LA has been put into question by many private investors

191
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:19,549
who believe that most Californians will ultimately just continue choosing to fly overtaking the rail

192
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,870
especially if flying ends up being cheaper and ultimately ends up being quicker in the end

193
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,429
And it's not just private investment that has been hard to come by either

194
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:33,429
In 2019, the Trump administration canceled nearly 1 billion in federal funding for the railway

195
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,350
setting frustrations over the lack of progress in construction and budget overruns

196
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,870
And last year, in 2021, the much more train friendly

197
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:53,110
biting administration passed through an infrastructure bill that granted $66 billion to Amtrak to further develop the Acela Express in the northeast and to build out new services elsewhere across the country

198
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,529
But it didn't include any precisely designated funding for california's high speed rail

199
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:06,470
Some sources believe that California may only get as little as $5 billion in funding for the project from the bill

200
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:13,350
which won't really help all that much with the presently estimated $105000000000 total price tag

201
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:21,789
There are grave fears among many in california's government that once the central segment between Bakersfield and Merced is completed at a price tag of around $23 billion

202
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:31,669
the state will then struggle to find the funding required to finish out the estimated $50000000000 leg from Bakersfield to Los Angeles

203
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:40,049
that requires lengthy and expensive mountain tunnels and the estimated 22 billion lay connecting the Central Valley to San Francisco

204
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,629
If the tens of billions of dollars worth of additional funding can't be found

205
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,190
california may end up being left with what the critics have been slamming the project for all along

206
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,549
an isolated high speed train to know it through the central Valley from Bakersfield

207
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,149
populations 380000, tomer said, population 80000

208
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,309
And since the funding to ultimately complete the project remains too low

209
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:11,429
the project has been plagued with ineffective management and no clear guidance from the state governments on what the project's actual next steps are going to look like

210
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:15,789
And then the covent 19 pandemic certainly didn't do the project any favors

211
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,470
either construction workers currently employed on the project

212
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,590
or at less than half of the numbers they were estimated to be at by this point before the pandemic

213
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,750
Overall, if it's ever finished

214
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,830
the California High Speed Railway could provide enormous potential benefits to the millions of citizens of California

215
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,190
But in order to do so

216
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:39,429
the project is struggling against the enormous challenges of geography, economics, demographics

217
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,429
america's own cultural and historical preferences for cars and planes, the legal system and more

218
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,990
all of which combine to make the project's ultimate future uncertain

219
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:57,549
The success or failure of america's 1st truly major high speed rail system is literally hanging in the balance

220
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,590
and it has a ton of catching up to do with the rest of the world

221
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,339
But it be fair, any engineering project like this has its challenges

222
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,440
And if you're anything like me

223
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,920
