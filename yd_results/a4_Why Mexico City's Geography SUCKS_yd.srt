1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
this is mexico city. it is currently the 6th largest city in the entire world, with nearly 3 million more people than new york

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,900
and it's by far the largest spanish speaking city in the world

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:16,800
mexico city is high on the list of the worlds most significant and influential cities

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:29,850
but it has one enormous and one very old the entire city is sinking into the ground at an insanely alarming rate, with some parts at about half a meter every single year

5
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:49,549
that is so fast that many geologists have predicted most of mexico city will sink about meters beneath where it currently stands by the end of the st with some particularly heavy head areas sinking more than 30 m imagine your house sinking 30 m beneath where it is today

6
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,170
that would be a hole so deep, if you stood at the top and jumped in, it'd take about two and a half seconds for you to hit the bottom

7
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:05,349
unfortunately for millions of mexicans, this is exactly what's going to happen to them very slowly over the course of the next few decades

8
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,569
and it's all because humans are really, really prone to choosing objectively terrible locations to place their cities in

9
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:18,790
mexico city, in particular, has some of the worst geography stats of any major city in the world

10
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,969
and this is why let's rewind the geographical and historical clock back a little over 700 years ago

11
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,870
back then, the region's geography and reality was very different from today

12
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:39,849
the city didn't exist, and in its place was a large lake called lake texkoco, wedged in a large valley surrounded by high mountains and volcanoes on all sides

13
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:59,530
legend has it that for a hundred years before this, the nomadic mexico tribe awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy they would eventually settle down and build the greatest city in the world, where the location would be determined wherever they saw an eagle eating a snake in its beak while perched a top a cactus

14
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:16,449
eventually, this prophecy would be realized when the mexico finally saw this exact vision in the most unlikely of places for the greatest city the world would ever see, a small, unpopulated and swampy island right here in the middle of lake texkoco

15
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,669
but undeterred by the formidable terrain, the mexico kept true to their prophecy and began building their great city

16
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:37,870
and over the next two centuries, this small, swampy island was continually enlarged by landfills and floating gardens, until it eventually evolved into tanochitlan, the capital of the aztec empire and one of the largest cities in the entire medieval world

17
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:51,689
by the time the spanish arrived in 15 in 19 tono stetlan was five times the size of london under henry the 8th, and at the time, considering the aztecs position on the tech tree, the city's geography didn't actually seem so bad

18
00:02:51,949 --> 00:03:03,590
without being fortunate enough to have any pack animals like horses or oxen, and without having discovered any practical use of the wheel, the aztecs had no other means available to them for transporting goods and conducting trade

19
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,830
then, by moving across the water on boats to notes, delon's various canals easily facilitated this role

20
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:21,389
and when you combine that with a complex series of dams they built that provided abundant, clean drinking water, extremely rich in fertile soil, and a highly defensible position surrounded by a literal moat

21
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,610
it's no wonder that the city became meso america's most successful

22
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:45,789
that is, until the spanish and cortes arrived in 1519, tanojdelan was put under a brutal siege, and under cortes' direct orders, the aztec dams across the lake were destroyed in order to turn lake texoco salt and deny the astex inside of any access to clean drinking water without their drinking water

23
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:57,849
and after a virulent smallpox epidemic, the astex inside withered away, and the spanish conquered and subsequently raised the city almost completely to the ground, brick by brick

24
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:05,400
by the end of the 16th century, the once great city of tonochitlan's population had declined by over 90 %

25
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,199
and atop the ruins, the spaniards founded their new settlement, called mexico city, and this is when the big problems really began

26
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,959
the spaniards never rebut the aztec dams and dikes and replace them with more familiar streets, public squares

27
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,800
instead. on the plus side, this allowed them to gradually reclaim more and more land from the lake to make more space for mexico cities growing population and buildings

28
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:37,160
but on the other side, this meant that the city was expanding into a swamp that was surrounded by a lake without any dam to keep out any of the lakes water flooding

29
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:49,139
therefore it became a constant problem for mexico city as it expanded and grew, including one particularly bad case in 1629, when the city flooded for five straight years

30
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,720
the spanish crown even discussed moving the location of the city to a bit less geographically problematic place

31
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:03,189
but evidently they thought they just decided to stay and drain the lake even more and even more instead under the aztecs

32
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,509
to notes to lan's population was around 40000

33
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,750
at its peak, and was basically just a small but very dense dot within lake tex cocoa

34
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:11,829
by

35
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,470
19 hundred, the

36
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,029
population here was actually pretty much the same

37
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,329
but the 20th century would see the city's population absolutely skyrocket

38
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,930
by 1950, the city had grown to cover 30 sq mi

39
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:29,029
and was home to over 3 million people

40
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:36,730
and today, mexico city has grown from there to cover an area of approximately 3000 sq mi

41
00:05:36,949 --> 00:06:00,649
and with nearly 22 million people. this enormous development in just a hundred years has effectively wiped out any trace of the former waters of lake texkoco and covered it instead with a lake of concrete and its wreaked total havoc on the valleys environment mexico cities, in a region that receives even more rain fall in infamously rainy places like london or seattle

42
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,009
but despite that, the city perpetually struggles to provide enough water for her citizens

43
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:15,500
without the waters of latex cocoa, the city has been forced to drill deeper and deeper into the below ground aquifers in her ever desperate quest for water

44
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,860
the problem here is that the land beneath mexico city is an ancient, soft clay lakebed

45
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:32,040
at as mexico city drills for more and more water, the clay weakens and crumbles the water pressure within the aquifer's support the soil above it, which in turn supports the city above it

46
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,819
however, as the water is drained and removed, the soil above compacts

47
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:56,240
this complexion, combined with the lower water pressure pushing from beneath, will slowly cause the city to sink over time, and rainwater can't easily get into the aquifers to replenish them, because the land and above is now absolutely covered in the concrete, sprawling chaos of the world's 6th largest city

48
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,649
and as a result, mexico city is trapped in a vicious geologic cycle

49
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,389
as the population grows, the demand for water further increases

50
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:24,829
but without the waters of the natural lake, she has then left with no other choice but to drill deeper into the below ground aquifers, which reduces the soil stability above and leads to the city sinking even further and further with the increased development above from the increasing population, rainwater can't get in to replenish the aquifers, and the soil's instability continues to get worse

51
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:40,790
climate change even further exacerbates these already dire conditions, since more heat and more drought in the region inevitably also means more evaporation and even more demand for the already scarce water supply, leading to even further drilling and, of course, even further sinking

52
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:51,269
mexico city, of course, knows all of this, and through a complex series of canals and pipes, they now import about 40 % of their water supply from other regions of mexico

53
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,750
however, these canals and pipes are wildly inefficient

54
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:06,449
constantly shifting elevation causes pipes below the ground to routinely crack and burst, while the struggling city government is rarely capable of mounting any kind of significant repairs

55
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:14,790
and as a result of that, for every one gallon of water that is pumped into the pipes of mexico city, more than one 3rd of it will simply be lost

56
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:29,709
and the energy that require to pump all of that water up to a city that's a mile and a half high in elevation in the mountains, is more than what the entire city of kuuebla consumes, a city with roughly the same population as philadelphia

57
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:40,090
so as a result, mexico city faces water shortages as if it were in the middle of a despite receiving more rainfall than london

58
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,929
and there isn't any easy or obvious solution for them to get out of this

59
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:52,950
but the city's singing problem affects far more than just the water supply, since it affects some areas worse than others, roads will suddenly buckle and wobble

60
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:55,370
buildings tip over and look like they're about to collapse

61
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:02,509
the metro system in some areas will resemble more of a roller coaster, while the destruction caused by earthquakes is greatly amplified

62
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:19,169
mexico city is unfortunately located within a seismically active zone, and with most of the city's core located on the weak and sulty clay lake bed, the soil will often behave more like a liquid during an earthquake, causing the buildings above to be even more greatly damaged than they otherwise would be

63
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:26,750
this is how in the mexico city, earthquake caused such catastrophic damage and loss in life to the city

64
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:35,370
mexico city's rapid and unexpected population explosion in the 20th century caused other unnatural problems to crop up as well

65
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:43,350
by two mexico city was home to more than 50000 industries and more than 4 million motor vehicles

66
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:55,889
due to the city's high elevation, a mile and a half above sea level, its oxygen levels are 25 % lower when compared to a city that is precisely at sea level, and therefore fuels don't combust as efficiently

67
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:06,049
for further mexico city is located within a high valley that's surrounded by tall mountains, which effectively keeps pollutants and exhaust trapped within without any place to go

68
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,610
this all meant that by 1992, the un had labeled mexico city as the world's most polluted city

69
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:20,389
but 30 years later, after a variety of methods, mexico city has managed to get their air pollution levels down in the valley to about the same level scene in los angeles

70
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,889
today. but air pollution continues to be the 8th

71
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:28,909
leading cause of death within mexico and causes about one in every 17 deaths in the country

72
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,509
for the aztec seven centuries ago, settling

73
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:40,779
on an island in lake texkoco, not only fulfilled an ancient prophecy, but made perfect geographic sense with their understanding of technology and limited population at the time

74
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:51,259
in the current day, though, it's one of the worst locations imaginable for the industrialized world's 6th largest city, and has caused countless problems for centuries

75
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:56,639
but it's too late now, since pushing mexico city somewhere else just isn't really feasible

76
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:05,960
mexico city's countless geographic problems are just effect of life now, and something that has to be lived with, because in the end, nature will always win

77
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:14,279
mexico city struggle against her environment has been one of the most massive and intimidating projects that humanity has had to have, ever undertaken

78
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,820
maybe you're watching this and you've got your own project or personal goal that you've been meaning to start recently that you thank you

79
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,580
similarly challenging, and as a result, you're unsure that you have the skills required to go about doing it

80
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:37,100
just yet. whatever it is you're wanting to do, whether it's getting started, creating your own youtube channel, making videos like this one or any other big project, the best place to get started is over on skill share

81
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,419
five years ago, i was in the exact same position as you

82
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:47,580
the project that i wanted to start was my youtube channel, but i had absolutely zero idea what i was doing or how to even get started

83
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,320
i never went to school for or art, and i doubt in my abilities to ever create anything than anyone would actually want to watch

84
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:00,360
in the end, i had to teach myself over the years by watching tutorial videos online here on youtube

85
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:12,720
but eventually i got introduced to skill share, and through targeted classes like this one called make animated youtube videos by evan from polly matter, whose since become my friend, i accelerated my learning even further
